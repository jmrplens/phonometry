# Speech Intelligibility Index (SII)

The **Speech Intelligibility Index** predicts how much of a speech signal is
audible, and therefore intelligible, to a listener in a given noise and hearing
condition. It reduces a speech spectrum, a noise spectrum and a hearing
threshold to a single number in `[0, 1]`: `0` when nothing useful reaches the
listener, `1` when the whole speech-bearing spectrum is audible. This page
covers the **one-third-octave-band method** of **ANSI S3.5-1997 (R2017)** — 18
bands from 160 Hz to 8000 Hz.

> [!NOTE]
> **SII vs STI.** The SII predicts intelligibility from *audibility* — how much
> of the speech spectrum clears the noise and the hearing threshold at the
> listener's ear — while the STI characterises a *transmission channel*: how
> much of the speech modulation a room or sound system preserves. For the
> latter, see the [Speech Transmission Index guide](speech-transmission.md).

## 1. Inputs and the band-importance function

All three inputs are **equivalent spectrum levels** (ANSI S3.5-1997 clauses 3.11
and 3.55) sampled at the 18 one-third-octave band centres: the speech spectrum
level `Ei'`, the noise spectrum level `Ni'` (both in dB SPL) and the hearing
threshold `Ti'` (in dB HL). Each band `i` contributes to intelligibility in
proportion to its **band-importance function** `Ii` (ANSI S3.5-1997 Table 3,
average speech material), which sums to one across the 18 bands.

```python
import phonometry as ph

# The standard normal-effort speech spectrum (Table 3) in quiet, normal hearing.
result = ph.speech_intelligibility_index("normal")
print(round(result.sii, 3))          # 0.996  (nearly everything audible)
print(round(ph.sii.BAND_IMPORTANCE.sum(), 6))   # 1.0
```

With no noise and a normal hearing threshold the standard speech spectrum is
almost fully audible, so the index is close to one; the small deficit is the
listener's own **self-speech masking**.

The importance function is where the perceptual knowledge of the standard
lives. It descends from the articulation experiments behind French and
Steinberg's articulation index: listeners scored nonsense syllables heard
through filters that removed one part of the spectrum at a time, and the drop
in score measures how much intelligibility each band carries. The outcome is
strikingly unequal, and unrelated to where the speech *energy* sits: the five
bands from 1250 Hz to 3150 Hz carry about 43 % of intelligibility (the place
and manner cues of consonants live there), while the five lowest bands, 160 Hz
to 400 Hz, carry about 11 % even though they hold nearly half of the speech
power.
`Ii` from Table 3 is the average-speech compromise; the standard's Annex B
tabulates alternative importance functions for specific test materials
(nonsense syllables, monosyllabic word lists, short passages), which shift
weight according to how much redundancy the material offers.

## 2. Masking and the band-audibility function

The procedure (ANSI S3.5-1997 clause 5) turns the inputs into a per-band
audibility. Speech masks itself downward from each band (`Vi = Ei' - 24`); the
larger of that and the external noise, `Bi`, spreads **upward** in frequency
with a level-dependent slope to give the equivalent masking spectrum level `Zi`
(clause 5.4):

$$
Z_i = 10\log_{10}\!\left(10^{0.1 N_i'} + \sum_{k<i}
      10^{0.1\left(B_k + 3.32\,C_k\,\log_{10}(0.89\,f_i/f_k)\right)}\right).
$$

The masking is combined with the equivalent internal noise
(`Xi' = Xi + Ti'`, the reference internal noise shifted by the hearing loss)
into the **equivalent disturbance** `Di` (clause 5.6), and the **band-audibility
function** is the speech-to-disturbance ratio scaled into `[0, 1]` (clause 5.8):

$$
A_i = \operatorname{clip}\!\left(\frac{E_i' - D_i + 15}{30},\; 0,\; 1\right).
$$

At speech levels well above normal effort a **level-distortion factor** of
clause 5.7 — unity for the standard spectra used on this page — reduces $A_i$
further; phonometry applies it automatically.

## 3. The index in noise

The Speech Intelligibility Index is the band-importance-weighted sum of the band
audibilities (ANSI S3.5-1997 clause 6):

$$
\text{SII} = \sum_{i} I_i\, A_i .
$$

```python
import numpy as np
import phonometry as ph

speech = ph.standard_speech_spectrum("normal")
# A descending broadband masking noise (an office/ventilation-like spectrum).
noise = np.array([38.0, 37.0, 36.0, 34.0, 32.0, 30.0, 28.0, 26.0, 24.0,
                  22.0, 20.0, 18.0, 16.0, 14.0, 12.0, 10.0, 8.0, 6.0])

result = ph.speech_intelligibility_index(speech, noise)
print(round(result.sii, 2))                # 0.46
print(result.band_audibility.round(2))     # per-band Ai
```

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import phonometry as ph

speech = ph.standard_speech_spectrum("normal")
noise = np.array([38.0, 37.0, 36.0, 34.0, 32.0, 30.0, 28.0, 26.0, 24.0,
                  22.0, 20.0, 18.0, 16.0, 14.0, 12.0, 10.0, 8.0, 6.0])
result = ph.speech_intelligibility_index(speech, noise)

# One line:
result.plot()
plt.show()

# By hand, mirroring what SIIResult.plot() draws:
pos = np.arange(result.frequencies.size)
weighted = result.band_audibility * result.band_importance
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.bar(pos, result.band_audibility, color="#c6dbef", label=r"Band audibility $A_i$")
ax.bar(pos, weighted / weighted.max(), width=0.5, color="#1f77b4",
       label=r"Importance-weighted $I_i A_i$ (scaled)")
ax.set_xticks(pos)
ax.set_xticklabels([f"{f:g}" for f in result.frequencies], rotation=45, ha="right")
ax.set_xlabel("One-third-octave band [Hz]")
ax.set_ylabel("Band audibility")
ax.set_title(f"SII = {result.sii:.2f}")
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

</details>

A raised hearing threshold (`threshold=`) lifts the equivalent internal noise
and lowers the index, exactly as added masking noise does. The
`SIIResult` also carries the per-band masking `Zi`, disturbance `Di`, audibility
`Ai` and importance `Ii`, and its `.plot()` renders the figure above.

## 4. Vocal effort

Talkers raise their voice in noise, and the standard gives four **standard
speech spectra** for the vocal efforts *normal*, *raised*, *loud* and *shout*
(ANSI S3.5-1997 Table 3). Passing the effort name selects the corresponding
spectrum; speaking louder lifts the whole spectrum and, in a fixed noise, raises
the index.

```python
import numpy as np
import phonometry as ph

# The same broadband noise, four vocal efforts.
noise = np.array([48.0, 47.0, 46.0, 44.0, 42.0, 40.0, 38.0, 36.0, 34.0,
                  32.0, 30.0, 28.0, 26.0, 24.0, 22.0, 20.0, 18.0, 16.0])
for effort in ph.sii.VOCAL_EFFORTS:
    print(effort, round(ph.speech_intelligibility_index(effort, noise).sii, 2))
# normal 0.12 | raised 0.36 | loud 0.59 | shout 0.79

print(ph.standard_speech_spectrum("loud")[8])  # 42.16 dB SPL at 1 kHz
```

ax_i.set_xticks(pos)
ax_i.set_xticklabels([e.capitalize() for e in efforts])

The vocal-effort names work anywhere a speech spectrum is expected, including as
the first argument to `speech_intelligibility_index`.

## 5. SII or STI?

The two speech metrics answer different questions from different measurements,
and each is blind to what the other captures:

| | SII (ANSI S3.5) | STI (IEC 60268-16) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Question answered | Is enough of the speech spectrum *audible* at the listener's ear? | How much of the speech *envelope* does the transmission channel preserve? |
| Inputs | Speech, noise and hearing-threshold spectra (18 one-third-octave equivalent spectrum levels) | An impulse response (indirect) or a STIPA recording through the channel (direct) |
| Band machinery | Band-importance weighting `Ii` applied to the band audibility `Ai` | Modulation transfer function m(F) per octave band, converted to an effective SNR |
| Captures | Steady noise, upward spread of masking, hearing loss, vocal effort, level distortion | Reverberation, echoes, noise and (measured directly) non-linear processing |
| Blind to | Reverberation and any time-domain smearing: a fully audible but hopelessly reverberant channel still scores high | Individual hearing status: hearing-impaired listeners need specific corrections |
| Typical use | Audiology, hearing aids and protectors, noise-control targets at a listener position | PA systems, intercoms and rooms: rating a transmission channel end to end |

The same space can pass one and fail the other. A quiet, highly reverberant
atrium is an SII near 1 with a poor STI; a dry office flooded by ventilation
noise can rate an acceptable STI from its impulse response while the SII (and
the noise-aware STI, via `snr=` or `level=`) reveals that little of the speech
spectrum clears the noise. When both mechanisms are in play, compute both; the
inputs are cheap once the room and the noise have been measured. See the
[Speech Transmission Index guide](speech-transmission.md) for the STI side.
