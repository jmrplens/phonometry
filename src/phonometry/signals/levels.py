Integrated and statistical sound levels (Leq, LAeq, LN percentiles).

Every function here accepts a :class:`phonometry.io.Signal` in place of
the bare ``(x, fs)`` pair: the object read from a measurement file
already knows its sample rate and, when calibrated, its
digital-to-pascal factor, so asking the caller to repeat either is
asking for a transcription error. All of them or none: a function that
took the object but silently dropped its calibration -- one row away
from functions that honour it -- would compute a wrong level that looks
right, the exact failure the object exists to prevent. The bare-array
signatures are unchanged -- a plain array with an explicit ``fs`` and
``calibration_factor`` computes exactly what it always did.
