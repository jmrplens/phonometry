Sound insulation measured with sound intensity (ISO 15186).

This is the sound-**intensity** counterpart of the sound-pressure methods in
:mod:`phonometry.lab_insulation` (ISO 10140) and :mod:`phonometry.insulation`
(ISO 16283). Instead of an equivalent absorption area in the receiving room,
the transmitted sound power is measured directly by scanning an intensity
probe over a measurement surface enclosing the specimen. The main use is when
the traditional pressure method fails because of high flanking transmission
(ISO 15186-1:2000, Clause 1): the intensity method only captures the power
radiated by the element itself.

**Intensity sound reduction index (ISO 15186-1:2000, Clause 3.8, Formula
(7)).** From the average source-room sound pressure level ``Lp1`` and the
average normal sound intensity level ``LIn`` over the measurement surface,

``RI = Lp1 - 6 - [LIn + 10 lg(Sm / S)]`` dB

with the measurement-surface area ``Sm`` and the specimen area ``S``. The
constant ``6`` dB is the diffuse-field relationship between the sound pressure
level and the sound intensity level incident on the specimen. The same formula
yields the *apparent* index ``R'I`` in the field (ISO 15186-2), the only
difference being the measurement condition (flanking is not suppressed), not
the arithmetic.

**Modified intensity sound reduction index (Clause 3.10, Formula (9)).**
``RI,M = RI + Kc`` corrects ``RI`` so that it reproduces the ISO 140-3 (now
ISO 10140-2) pressure result, which slightly overestimates ``R`` because the
power radiated into the receiving room is underestimated. The adaptation term
``Kc`` (Annex B) is ``10 lg(1 + Sb2 lambda / (8 V2))`` (Formula (B.1)) for a
well-defined receiving room of boundary area ``Sb2`` and volume ``V2``, or the
room-independent approximation ``10 lg(1 + 61,4 / f)`` (Formula (B.2)); both
use the speed of sound ``c = 340 m/s`` so that (B.1) with the reference room
``Sb2 = 117 m²``, ``V2 = 81 m³`` reduces to (B.2).

**Intensity element normalized level difference (Clause 3.9, Formula (8)).**
For small building elements, ``DI,n,e = Lp1 - 6 - (LIn + 10 lg(Sm / A0) +
10 lg N)`` dB with the reference absorption area ``A0 = 10 m²`` and the number
``N`` of element units in the measurement surface.

**Surface pressure-intensity indicator (Clause 3.6 / 6.4.2, Formula (10)).**
``FpI = Lp - LIn`` qualifies the measurement surface: it must stay below
10 dB for a sound-reflecting specimen (below 6 dB when the receiving side is
sound absorbing), and the probe's pressure-residual intensity index must
exceed ``FpI + 10`` dB (Clause 4.1) for the dynamic capability to be adequate.

**Frequency range (Clause 6.6).** Quantities are measured over the mandatory
one-third-octave range 100 Hz to 5000 Hz (18 bands), optionally extended down
to 50 Hz. The single-number weighted rating uses the ISO 717-1 core range, so
the automatic rating (``RI,w``, ``RI,M,w``, ``DI,n,e,w``) is formed via the
verified :func:`phonometry.weighted_rating` engine only when exactly 16
one-third-octave (100-3150 Hz) or 5 octave (125-2000 Hz) values are supplied.
