# Multiple-shock whole-body vibration (ISO 2631-5)

Vibration that contains repeated **mechanical shocks** (off-road vehicles,
high-speed marine craft, earth-moving machinery) loads the lumbar spine far
more than its equivalent r.m.s. level suggests. **ISO 2631-5:2018** predicts
the resulting spinal response and the risk of lumbar injury from the measured
vertical seat acceleration. phonometry implements the normative **Clause 5**
spinal-response model and the **Annex C** health-effect assessment. (The Annex A
/ Annex E finite-element model is distributed by ISO as separate software and is
out of scope here.)

The boundary with the basic method is explicit. ISO 2631-1 declares its r.m.s.
evaluation normally sufficient up to a crest factor of 9, and offers the
running r.m.s./MTVV and the VDV beyond it; ISO 2631-5 is the additional method
for the regime past those, where the record contains repeated shocks. Its
clause 4 then splits that regime in two: *severe* conditions with possible
free fall or loss of contact with the seat and a dominant z-axis (military
off-road vehicles, high-speed marine craft) use the clause 5 model implemented
here, while *less severe* conditions in which the occupant stays seated
throughout (tractors, forestry and earth-moving machinery on rough ground)
belong to the Annex A finite-element model. In case of doubt the delineation
is quantitative: when the band-limited vertical peak acceleration exceeds
9.81 m/s² (1 g, the free-fall threshold), clause 5 and Annex C apply.

## 1. Spinal response (clause 5.2)

A seat-to-spine transfer function ``H(f)`` (one complex zero and six complex
poles, unity transmissibility at 0 Hz and a resonance near 5 Hz) maps the
measured seat acceleration to the vertical spinal response ``Az(t)``
(Formula 1/2):

$$
A_z(t) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\!\left[H(f)\,\mathcal{F}[a_z(t)]\right].
$$

The input record must be **conditioned (DC-removed)**: because `H` is unity at
0 Hz by design, a DC offset (e.g. the 1 g gravity component of a DC-coupled
accelerometer) passes straight into `Az(t)` and corrupts the positive response
peaks of the dose. Subtract the mean (or high-pass) before processing.

```python
from phonometry import vibration

# The transmissibility peaks near the ~5 Hz spinal resonance.
print(round(abs(vibration.seat_to_spine_transfer([2.0])[0]), 2))  # 1.06
print(round(abs(vibration.seat_to_spine_transfer([5.0])[0]), 2))  # 1.54
```

## 2. Acceleration dose (clause 5.3)

The **acceleration dose** combines the positive response peaks ``Az,i`` (each
the maximum between two consecutive zero crossings) with a sixth-power law, so
the largest shocks dominate (Formula 3):

$$
D_z = 1.07\left(\sum_i A_{z,i}^{\,6}\right)^{1/6}.
$$

A daily dose scales the measured dose to the daily exposure time ``td`` over the
measurement time ``tm`` (Formula 4): ``Dzd = Dz * (td/tm)**(1/6)``.

```python
from phonometry import vibration

# Five 40 m/s2 response peaks in a day (the Annex C worked example).
print(round(vibration.dose_from_peaks([40.0] * 5), 2))  # 55.97  m/s2
```

## 3. Injury risk (Annex C)

The daily dose becomes a daily **compressive stress** ``Sd = mz * Dzd``
(Formula C.1), where ``mz`` (0.029 MPa per m/s² for an 82 kg male, 0.025 for a
64 kg female) converts acceleration to vertebral stress. The stress accumulates
over the exposure years against the ageing spine's reducing ultimate strength
``Su = 6.75 - Sage*(b+i)`` (Formulae C.3/C.4):

$$
R = \left[\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}
\left(\frac{S_d\,N^{1/6}}{S_{u,i} - S_{\mathrm{stat}}}\right)^{6}\right]^{1/6},
$$

and a Weibull model gives the probability of lumbar injury (Formula C.5):

$$
\Pi(R) = 1 - \exp\!\left[-\left(\frac{R}{\alpha}\right)^{\beta}\right].
$$

```python
from phonometry import vibration

# Annex C worked example: 5 x 40 m/s2/day, 82 kg male, age 20 for 20 years,
# 120 days/year.
dz = vibration.dose_from_peaks([40.0] * 5)
sd = vibration.compression_dose(dz)                     # 1.62 MPa
r = vibration.injury_risk(sd, start_age=20, years=20, days_per_year=120)
print(round(r, 2))                               # 1.22
print(round(100 * vibration.injury_probability(r)))     # 37  % risk of injury
```

From a measured time history the whole chain is one call:

```python
import numpy as np
from phonometry import vibration

# A synthetic 10 s seat record at 256 Hz with five 60 m/s2 shocks (stand-in
# for a measured az(t)).
fs = 256.0
az = np.zeros(2560)
az[256::512] = 60.0
result = vibration.multiple_shock_assessment(
    az, fs, start_age=20, years=20, days_per_year=120, sex="male",
)
print(round(result.acceleration_dose, 2))  # 20.94  m/s2
print(round(result.risk, 2))               # 0.46
print(round(result.probability, 2))        # 0.03
```

The `MultipleShockResult` carries the dose ``Dz``, the daily dose ``Dzd``, the
compressive stress ``Sd``, the stress variable ``R``, the injury probability and
the response peaks, and its `.plot()` draws the injury-probability curve with the
10/50/90 % risk thresholds of Table C.2. The model is vertical-axis only:
clause 4 neglects the horizontal contributions to spinal compression by design,
and the horizontal spinal model of the withdrawn 2004 edition is not reinstated,
so horizontal whole-body exposure is assessed instead with the r.m.s.,
running-r.m.s./MTVV and VDV metrics of [Human Vibration](human-vibration.md)
(ISO 2631-1).

## 4. The health-risk report (`.report()`)

The dose chain exists to be written down and read against the Annex C guidance.
`MultipleShockResult.report(path)` writes a one-page PDF health-risk assessment
sheet: the standard-basis line (Clause 5 spinal response and the Annex C risk
model), an optional metadata header (client, subject via `specimen`,
workplace/vehicle via `test_room`, and the `instrumentation` and `calibration`
free-text fields of `ReportMetadata`), the exposure-scenario grid (subject sex,
the age `b` at which the exposure started, the number of exposure years `n`, the
number of exposure days per year `N` and the number of counted response shocks),
and the dose-and-stress analysis table with the acceleration dose `Dz`
(Formula 3), the daily dose `Dzd` (Formula 4), the daily compressive stress `Sd`
(Formula C.1), the cumulative stress variable `R` (Formula C.3) and the
probability of lumbar injury `Π` (Formula C.5).

Because ISO 2631-5:2018 defines no exposure limit, the fiche carries a risk-band
zone row rather than a PASS/FAIL verdict: the boxed `R` and `Π` name the Annex C
risk classification, and a classification table places `R` among the Table C.2
stress variables for 10 / 50 / 90 % risk of injury (low / moderate / high / very
high probability of an adverse health effect), with the injury-probability chart
above it. `language="es"` renders the Spanish fiche (comma decimals). Rendering
needs the optional `phonometry[report]` extra (reportlab), plus matplotlib for
the chart.

The relevant `ReportMetadata` fields for a multiple-shock report are `client`,
`specimen` (the subject), `test_room` (the workplace or vehicle), `test_date`,
`instrumentation`, `calibration`, and the footer identity `laboratory`,
`operator`, `report_id` and `notes`.

```python
import numpy as np
from phonometry import vibration, ReportMetadata

# The Annex C worked example, rebuilt from its five 40 m/s2 response peaks.
peaks = np.array([40.0] * 5)
dz = vibration.dose_from_peaks(peaks)
sd = vibration.compression_dose(dz)
r = vibration.injury_risk(sd, start_age=20, years=20, days_per_year=120)
result = vibration.MultipleShockResult(
    sex="male",
    acceleration_dose=dz,
    daily_dose=dz,
    compression_dose=sd,
    risk=r,
    probability=float(vibration.injury_probability(r)),
    start_age=20.0,
    years=20,
    days_per_year=120.0,
    peaks=peaks,
    risk_thresholds=vibration.RISK_THRESHOLDS_MALE,
)
result.report(
    "multiple_shock.pdf",
    metadata=ReportMetadata(
        client="Example transport operator",
        specimen="82 kg male operator (seated)",
        test_room="Off-road vehicle, driver's seat",
        report_id="EXAMPLE-2631-5",
    ),
)   # R = 1.22, Pi = 37 % -> moderate probability of an adverse health effect
```
