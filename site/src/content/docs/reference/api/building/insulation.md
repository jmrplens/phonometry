Field airborne sound insulation (ISO 16283-1:2014) and impact sound
insulation (ISO 16283-2), with single-number weighted ratings and
spectrum adaptation terms (ISO 717-1 airborne, ISO 717-2 impact).

**Field quantities (ISO 16283-1:2014).** From the energy-average sound
pressure levels in the source and receiving rooms this module forms the
level difference `D = L1 - L2` (Clause 3.12, Formula (1)), the
standardized level difference `DnT = D + 10 lg(T/T0)` with the
reference reverberation time `T0 = 0,5 s` (Clause 3.13, Formula (2)),
and the apparent sound reduction index
`R' = D + 10 lg(S/A)` with the Sabine equivalent absorption area
`A = 0,16 V / T` (Clause 3.14/3.15, Formula (4) and (5)). Source and
receiving levels may be supplied already averaged (one value per band) or
as several microphone positions, which are then energy-averaged with
`10 lg( (1/n) sum 10^(Li/10) )` (Clause 7.8, Formula (9)). All
quantities are evaluated per one-third-octave band over the core range
100 Hz to 3150 Hz (Clause 5), the caller having already applied any
background-noise correction (Clause 9.2).

**Weighted rating (ISO 717-1).** The reference-curve method of Clause 4.4
shifts the reference curve of Table 3 in 1 dB steps towards the measured
curve until the sum of unfavourable deviations (measured below the
shifted reference) is as large as possible but not more than 32,0 dB for
the 16 one-third-octave bands (100 Hz to 3150 Hz) or 10,0 dB for the 5
octave bands (125 Hz to 2000 Hz). The weighted rating (`Rw`, `R'w`,
`Dn,w`, `DnT,w` ...) is the shifted reference read at 500 Hz. The
spectrum adaptation terms are `C = XA1 - Xw` and `Ctr = XA2 - Xw`
with `XAj = -10 lg sum 10^((Lij - Xi)/10)` rounded to an integer, using
the A-weighted spectra No. 1 (pink noise, `C`) and No. 2 (urban traffic,
`Ctr`) of Table 4 (Clause 4.5, Formula (1) and (2)). Input levels are
reduced to one decimal place before use (Clause 4.4, footnote 1). The
reference values, spectra and shifting rule are identical in the 2013 and
2020 editions of ISO 717-1.

**Enlarged frequency ranges (ISO 717-1 Annex B; ISO 717-2 A.2.1 NOTE).**
When measurements cover an enlarged range, additional adaptation terms are
stated with the range as a subscript: `C50-3150`, `C50-5000`,
`C100-5000` (and the `Ctr` counterparts) with the Table B.1 spectra, and
`CI,50-2500` for impact. [`weighted_rating_extended`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#weighted_rating_extended) and
[`weighted_impact_rating_extended`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#weighted_impact_rating_extended) compute them alongside the core
rating. Both accept `one_decimal=True` for the "1/10 dB for the expression
of uncertainty" variant of Clauses 4.4/4.5 (reference-curve shift in 0,1 dB
steps and one-decimal reductions), which ISO 12999-1:2020 Annex B requires
when stating the uncertainty of single-number values.

**Field impact quantities (ISO 16283-2).** With the tapping machine as the
impact source this module forms, from the energy-average impact sound
pressure level `Li` in the receiving room, the standardized impact sound
pressure level `L'nT = Li - 10 lg(T/T0)` with `T0 = 0,5 s` (Clause
3.13, Formula (1)) and the normalized impact sound pressure level
`L'n = Li + 10 lg(A/A0)` with the Sabine absorption area `A = 0,16 V/T`
and the reference area `A0 = 10 m²` (Clause 3.14, Formula (2)). Levels
may be supplied already averaged or as several microphone positions, then
energy-averaged (Clause 7.8, Formula (10)), over the core one-third-octave
range 100 Hz to 3150 Hz (Clause 5.1).

**Field façade quantities (ISO 16283-3:2016).** With an outdoor sound
source this module forms, from the level 2 m in front of the façade
`L1,2m` and the receiving-room level `L2`, the level difference
`D2m = L1,2m - L2` (Clause 3.14), its standardized form
`D2m,nT = D2m + 10 lg(T/T0)` with `T0 = 0,5 s` (Clause 3.15) and
normalized form `D2m,n = D2m - 10 lg(A/A0)` with the Sabine absorption
area `A = 0,16 V/T` (Clause 3.17) and reference `A0 = 10 m²`
(Clause 3.16): the global loudspeaker / traffic quantities
`Dls,2m,*` / `Dtr,2m,*`. When a surface level `L1,s` (microphone on
the test element) with the element area `S` and volume are given it
forms the apparent sound reduction index
`R'45° = L1,s - L2 + 10 lg(S/A) - 1,5` for the loudspeaker element method
(Clause 3.12) or `R'tr,s = L1,s - L2 + 10 lg(S/A) - 3` for the
road-traffic element method (Clause 3.13). These quantities are defined by
unnumbered formulas inline in the Clause 3 terms; positions are
energy-averaged with the surface-level formula (Clause 9.5.1, Formula (7)).
Quantities are evaluated over the core one-third-octave range 100 Hz to
3150 Hz (Clause 5), optionally extended to 50-5000 Hz. The façade quantity
is airborne, so its single-number rating uses the **ISO 717-1 airborne**
reference curve and method (Clause 2, Annex F) via [`weighted_rating`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#weighted_rating)
unchanged.

**Weighted impact rating (ISO 717-2).** The reference-curve method of
Clause 4.3 shifts the Table 3 impact reference curve towards the measured
curve until the sum of unfavourable deviations (here where the
**measurement exceeds** the reference, the sign opposite to airborne) is
as large as possible but not more than 32,0 dB (16 one-third-octave bands)
or 10,0 dB (5 octave bands). The rating (`Ln,w`, `L'n,w`, `L'nT,w`)
is the shifted reference read at 500 Hz, reduced by a further 5 dB for
octave bands (Clause 4.3.2). The spectrum adaptation term
`CI = Ln,sum - 15 - Ln,w` uses the energetic sum `Ln,sum` over
100 Hz to 2500 Hz (one-third octave) or 125 Hz to 2000 Hz (octave),
rounded to an integer (Clause A.2.1, Formulae (A.1) to (A.3)). The Table 3
reference values, the shifting rule and CI are identical in the 2013 and
2020 editions of ISO 717-2 (the 2020 edition only adds Annex D for the
rubber-ball heavy/soft impactor, out of scope here).

    method: str = 'loudspeaker',
    t0: float = 0.5,
    frequencies: Sequence[float] | np.ndarray | None = None,
) -> FacadeInsulationResult
```

Field façade sound insulation per ISO 16283-3:2016.

Computes, per frequency band, the global-method level difference
`D2m = L1,2m - L2` (Clause 3.14), its standardized form
`D2m,nT = D2m + 10 lg(T/T0)` (Clause 3.15) and, when the
receiving-room volume is given, its normalized form
`D2m,n = D2m - 10 lg(A/A0)` with the Sabine equivalent absorption
area `A = 0,16 V/T` (Clause 3.17) and `A0 = 10 m²` (Clause 3.16).
When a surface level `L1,s` (microphone on the test element),
together with the element area `S` and the volume, is supplied it
also computes the apparent sound reduction index of the element
method: `R'45° = L1,s - L2 + 10 lg(S/A) - 1,5` for a loudspeaker
source (Clause 3.12) or `R'tr,s = L1,s - L2 + 10 lg(S/A) - 3` for a
road-traffic source (Clause 3.13). The defining formulas are unnumbered
inline in the Clause 3 terms.

`l1_2m`, `l2` and `surface_level` may be one value per band
(already energy-averaged) or a two-dimensional `(positions, bands)`
array, in which case the positions are energy-averaged with the
surface-level formula (Clause 9.5.1, Formula (7)). Band levels are
assumed already corrected for background
noise. The single-number rating uses the ISO 717-1 airborne reference
curve (Annex F); pass the desired 16-band quantity to
[`weighted_rating`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#weighted_rating).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `l1_2m` | Outdoor sound pressure levels 2 m in front of the façade, in dB. |
| `l2` | Receiving-room sound pressure levels, in dB. |
| `t2` | Receiving-room reverberation time per band, in seconds. |
| `area` | Area `S` of the test element, in m² (optional; required with `volume` and `surface_level` for `R'`). |
| `volume` | Receiving-room volume `V`, in m³ (optional; required for `D2m,n` and for `R'`). |
| `surface_level` | Outdoor surface level `L1,s` on the test element, in dB (optional; required with `area` and `volume` for `R'`). |
| `method` | `"loudspeaker"` (45° incidence, -1,5 dB) or `"road_traffic"` (all-angle incidence, -3 dB); selects the `R'` correction (Clause 3.12 / 3.13). |
| `t0` | Reference reverberation time `T0`, in seconds (default 0,5 s for dwellings, Clause 3.15). |
| `frequencies` | Optional band centre frequencies, in Hz, carried on the result for plotting. |

**Returns:** [`FacadeInsulationResult`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#facadeinsulationresult) with `d_2m`, `d_2m_nt`, `d_2m_n` (`None` unless `volume` is given) and `r_prime` (`None` unless `surface_level`, `area` and `volume` are all given).

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | If band counts differ, if `method` is unknown, if `t2`/`t0`/`area`/`volume` are not positive, if `area` is given without `surface_level`, if `surface_level` and `area` are given without `volume`, if `frequencies` is given with a length that differs from the band count, or if inputs are non-finite. Supplying `surface_level` alone is not an error: `r_prime` simply stays `None`. |

bare Table 4 reference floor) and `CI,r` the ISO 717-2 spectrum
adaptation term of the reference floor with the covering under test,
`Ln,r = Ln,r,0 − ΔL` (Formula (1)). Together with
[`weighted_impact_improvement`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#weighted_impact_improvement) it yields the single-number reduction
for a flat spectrum, `ΔLlin = ΔLw + CI,Δ` (Formula (A.5)). ISO 16251-1
Clause 8 e) requires this term in the statement of results.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |

Render an ISO 16283-2 field impact sound-insulation report to a PDF.

Writes the one-page field test report of ISO 16283-2:2020 Clause 14
in the layout of the recommended Annex C form: the standard-basis
line, an optional metadata header block, the one-third-octave table
beside the measured-versus-shifted-reference curve, the boxed field
rating `L'nT,w (CI)` or `L'n,w (CI)` (evaluated per ISO 717-2
over the 16 core bands), the mandatory field-method statement, an
optional verdict row and a footer with the identity block and
disclaimer.

Render an ISO 717-2 impact-insulation fiche to a PDF.

Writes a one-page accredited-laboratory report for impact sound: the
standard-basis line, an optional metadata header block, the band
table beside the measured-versus-shifted-reference plot (the
result's own `plot`), the boxed `Ln,w (CI)` result, an
optional verdict row and a footer with the fixed disclaimer.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |

)
```

Descriptive metadata for the accredited ISO 717 report fiche.

All fields are optional (default `None`); the report renders only the
fields that are supplied, so a partially populated instance is valid. The
numeric fields are validated on construction by physical range: the
dimension, mass, volume and pressure fields must be finite and strictly
positive; the temperature and requirement fields need only be finite (0
degrees Celsius or below is a valid test condition, and a programme-loudness
target in LUFS is negative); and the relative-humidity fields must lie
within 0..100 %. A violation raises `ValueError`.

**Attributes**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `specimen` | Specimen description printed in the header (the tested element, e.g. `"200 mm concrete wall"`). |
| `client` | Client the test was carried out for. |
| `mounted_by` | Who mounted the specimen in the test opening. |
| `manufacturer` | Manufacturer of the tested element. |
| `area` | Specimen area `S`, in m^2 (the free test opening area). |
| `mass_per_area` | Measured mass per unit area, in kg/m^2. |
| `source_volume` | Source-room volume, in m^3. |
| `receiving_volume` | Receiving-room volume, in m^3. |
| `temperature` | Air temperature during the test, in degrees Celsius (a single representative value; use the per-room fields below when the source and receiving rooms are reported separately). |
| `relative_humidity` | Relative humidity during the test, in %. |
| `source_temperature` | Source-room air temperature, in degrees Celsius. |
| `source_relative_humidity` | Source-room relative humidity, in %. |
| `receiving_temperature` | Receiving-room air temperature, in degrees Celsius. |
| `receiving_relative_humidity` | Receiving-room relative humidity, in %. |
| `pressure` | Ambient (static) air pressure during the test, in kPa. |
| `test_room` | Test-room / facility identification. |
| `mounting` | Mounting condition of the specimen (e.g. the ISO 10140-1 mounting code or a short description). |
| `measurement_standard` | Measurement standard the spectrum was obtained under (e.g. `"ISO 10140-2"` or `"ISO 16283-1"`); it forms the report's standard-basis line together with the ISO 717 rating part. |
| `test_date` | Date of the test, as a free-form string. |
| `laboratory` | Testing laboratory / institute name (footer). |
| `operator` | Operator who carried out the test (footer signature line). |
| `report_id` | Report / test number (footer). |
| `requirement` | Target single-number value the verdict row compares the rating against, expressed in the rating's own unit (e.g. dB, a dimensionless absorption coefficient, sone, or a programme-loudness level in LUFS). It need only be finite (a loudness target in LUFS is negative), so its sign is not constrained. The pass direction is defined by each rating's `report` method: quantities where more is better (airborne insulation, absorption) pass at or above the requirement, and quantities where less is better (impact level, loudness, aircraft noise) pass at or below it; the programme-loudness fiche reads it as the target level and passes within a tolerance. |
| `required_class` | Target performance-class index for a class-compliance verdict (the IEC 61260-1 filter fiche): `0`, `1` or `2`, where class 0 is the strictest. When supplied, the fiche's verdict passes if the achieved overall class is at least as strict as this class (a smaller or equal class index). `None` (the default) prints no verdict row. |
| `notes` | Free-form remarks printed in the footer. |

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | If a supplied dimension/mass/volume/pressure is not finite and strictly positive, a temperature or requirement is not finite, a relative humidity is outside 0..100 %, or a required class is not one of 0, 1, 2. |

### ReportMetadata.is_empty()

```python
ReportMetadata.is_empty() -> bool
```

Return `True` when no field is set (an all-`None` instance).

## weighted_impact_improvement

```python
weighted_impact_improvement(delta_l: Sequence[float] | np.ndarray) -> int
```

Weighted reduction of impact sound pressure level `ΔLw` (ISO 717-2:2020 §5).

Relates a measured improvement spectrum `ΔL` to the heavyweight reference
floor of Table 4: the reference level with the covering is
`Ln,r = Ln,r,0 − ΔL` (Formula (1)) and the weighted improvement is
`ΔLw = Ln,r,0,w − Ln,r,w = 78 − Ln,r,w` (Formula (2)), where `Ln,r,w` is
the ISO 717-2 weighted rating of `Ln,r` from [`weighted_impact_rating`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#weighted_impact_rating).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `delta_l` | The reduction of impact sound pressure level `ΔL` per band, in dB; 16 one-third-octave values from 100 Hz to 3150 Hz (e.g. from a floor-covering measurement to ISO 10140-3 or ISO 16251-1). |

**Returns:** The weighted reduction `ΔLw`, in dB (rounded, per ISO 717-2).

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | If `delta_l` is not 16 one-third-octave values, or is non-finite. |

## weighted_impact_rating

```python
weighted_impact_rating(
    values_by_band: Sequence[float] | np.ndarray,
    bands: str | None = None,
) -> ImpactRatingResult
```

Single-number weighted impact rating and CI per ISO 717-2.

Applies the reference-curve method of Clause 4.3: the Table 3 impact
reference curve is shifted in 1 dB steps towards the measured curve
until the sum of unfavourable deviations is as large as possible but
not more than 32,0 dB (16 one-third-octave bands, 100 Hz to 3150 Hz)
or 10,0 dB (5 octave bands, 125 Hz to 2000 Hz). For impact sound an
unfavourable deviation occurs where the **measurement exceeds** the
reference (the sign opposite to ISO 717-1 airborne). The rating is the
shifted reference read at 500 Hz; for octave bands it is then reduced
by 5 dB (Clause 4.3.2). The spectrum adaptation term `CI` follows
Clause A.2.1. Input values are first reduced to one decimal place
(Clause 4.3.1, footnote 1).

The shift search reuses the verified engine of [`weighted_rating`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#weighted_rating)
on the negated curves: minimising `Σ max(0, measured - (ref + k))`
over `k` equals maximising `Σ max(0, (-ref) + (-k) - (-measured))`,
the airborne problem, so no separate search is duplicated.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `values_by_band` | Measured impact levels (`Ln`, `L'n`, `L'nT`) in dB. 16 values are read as one-third-octave bands, 5 values as octave bands. |
| `bands` | `"third-octave"`, `"octave"` or `None` to infer the band set from the number of values. |

**Returns:** [`ImpactRatingResult`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#impactratingresult) with `rating`, `ci` and `unfavourable_sum`.

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | If the number of values does not match the band set, or if any value is non-finite. |

## weighted_impact_rating_extended

```python
weighted_impact_rating_extended(
    values_by_band: Sequence[float] | np.ndarray,
    frequencies: Sequence[float] | np.ndarray | None = None,
    *,
    one_decimal: bool = False,
) -> ExtendedImpactRatingResult
```

Weighted impact rating with `CI,50-2500` (ISO 717-2:2020 A.2.1).

Computes the weighted impact rating from the core one-third-octave bands
100-3150 Hz (Clause 4.3) and, when the input covers 50-2500 Hz, the
enlarged-range spectrum adaptation term `CI,50-2500` of the A.2.1 NOTE:
the energetic sum runs over 50-2500 Hz instead of 100-2500 Hz in
Formula (A.1), `CI = Ln,sum − 15 − Ln,w`.

With `one_decimal=True` the reference-curve shift runs in 0,1 dB steps
and the sums keep one decimal place (Clauses 4.3.1/4.4; e.g. the
reference floor yields `Ln,r,0,w = 77,6 dB` and `CI,r,0 = −10,3 dB`
as printed in A.2.2).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `values_by_band` | Measured impact levels (`Ln`, `L'n`, `L'nT`) in dB, one-third-octave bands. |
| `frequencies` | Band centre frequencies, in Hz (one per value). `None` assumes exactly the 16 core bands 100-3150 Hz. |
| `one_decimal` | Use the 0,1 dB shift and one-decimal reductions. |

**Returns:** An [`ExtendedImpactRatingResult`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#extendedimpactratingresult).

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | If the input is not one-dimensional and finite, the band counts differ, or the core bands are missing. |

## weighted_rating

```python
weighted_rating(
    values_by_band: Sequence[float] | np.ndarray,
    bands: str | None = None,
) -> WeightedRatingResult
```

Single-number weighted rating and C / Ctr per ISO 717-1.

Applies the reference-curve method of Clause 4.4: the Table 3
reference curve is shifted in 1 dB steps towards the measured curve
until the sum of unfavourable deviations is as large as possible but
not more than 32,0 dB (16 one-third-octave bands, 100 Hz to 3150 Hz)
or 10,0 dB (5 octave bands, 125 Hz to 2000 Hz). The rating is the
shifted reference read at 500 Hz. The spectrum adaptation terms
`C` and `Ctr` follow Clause 4.5 with the Table 4 spectra No. 1 and
No. 2. Input values are first reduced to one decimal place
(Clause 4.4, footnote 1).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `values_by_band` | Measured band quantities (`R`, `R'`, `Dn`, `DnT` ...) in dB. 16 values are read as one-third-octave bands, 5 values as octave bands. |
| `bands` | `"third-octave"`, `"octave"` or `None` to infer the band set from the number of values. |

**Returns:** [`WeightedRatingResult`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#weightedratingresult) with `rating`, `c`, `ctr` and `unfavourable_sum`.

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | If the number of values does not match the band set, or if any value is non-finite. |

## weighted_rating_extended

```python
weighted_rating_extended(
    values_by_band: Sequence[float] | np.ndarray,
    frequencies: Sequence[float] | np.ndarray | None = None,
    *,
    one_decimal: bool = False,
) -> ExtendedWeightedRatingResult
```

Weighted rating with enlarged-range adaptation terms (ISO 717-1 Annex B).

Computes the weighted rating from the core one-third-octave bands
100-3150 Hz (Clause 4.4) and, for every enlarged frequency range covered
by the input, the additional spectrum adaptation terms of Annex B
(`C50-3150`, `C50-5000`, `C100-5000` and the `Ctr` counterparts)
with the Table B.1 spectra: `Cj = XAj − Xw` where `XAj` sums over the
bands of the enlarged range (Clause 4.5 with Annex B).

With `one_decimal=True` the reference-curve shift runs in 0,1 dB steps
and every reduction keeps one decimal place; the variant Clauses 4.4/4.5
prescribe "for the expression of uncertainty" and ISO 12999-1:2020
Annex B requires for the uncertainty of single-number values.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `values_by_band` | Measured band quantities (`R`, `R'`, `Dn`, `DnT` ...) in dB, one-third-octave bands. |
| `frequencies` | Band centre frequencies, in Hz (one per value). `None` assumes exactly the 16 core bands 100-3150 Hz. The 16 core bands must always be present; extended terms are formed for each Annex B range whose bands are all present. |
| `one_decimal` | Use the 0,1 dB shift and one-decimal reductions. |

**Returns:** An [`ExtendedWeightedRatingResult`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#extendedweightedratingresult).

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | If the input is not one-dimensional and finite, the band counts differ, or the core bands are missing. |
