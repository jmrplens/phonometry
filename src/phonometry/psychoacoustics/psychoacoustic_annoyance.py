Psychoacoustic annoyance (PA) after Fastl & Zwicker.

Psychoacoustic annoyance combines four hearing sensations -- loudness,
sharpness, fluctuation strength and roughness -- into a single figure that
tracks annoyance ratings from listening experiments. The model is due to
Widmann (1992) and is given in Fastl & Zwicker, *Psychoacoustics: Facts and
Models* (Equations 16.2-16.4):

    PA = N5 * sqrt(1 + wS**2 + wFR**2)

with the percentile loudness ``N5`` in sone and the two loudness-weighted terms

    wS  = (S - 1.75) * 0.25 * lg(N5 + 10)          for S > 1.75 acum, else 0
    wFR = (2.18 / N5**0.4) * (0.4 * F + 0.6 * R)

describing sharpness ``S`` (acum) and the joint influence of fluctuation
strength ``F`` (vacil) and roughness ``R`` (asper). There is no ISO standard
for PA; the formula is exact and is verified by self-consistency and against
the open SQAT reference implementation.

:func:`psychoacoustic_annoyance` evaluates the model from the four quantities
directly. :func:`psychoacoustic_annoyance_from_signal` is a convenience that
derives them from a calibrated pressure signal using the library's existing
models -- N5/S from ISO 532-1 Zwicker loudness and DIN 45692 sharpness, R from
ECMA-418-2 roughness and F from :func:`~phonometry.fluctuation_strength.
fluctuation_strength`. That composite mixes model families (Zwicker N5/S,
Sottek R, Osses F); the original PA model was calibrated with Zwicker-family
sensations, so the signal convenience is an engineering estimate, while
:func:`psychoacoustic_annoyance` is the exact model.
