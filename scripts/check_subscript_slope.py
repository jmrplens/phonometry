r"""Gate for a subscript that means two things on one page.

ISO 80000-2 settles the slope of a subscript by what the subscript *is*: a
quantity symbol stays italic (:math:`L_p`, pressure; :math:`L_W`, power), a
word or an abbreviation is upright (:math:`R_\mathrm{w}`, weighted), a number
is upright by definition, and an index that runs over a sum is italic. The
corpus applies that rule, and CONTRIBUTING.md states it.

What the rule does not settle is the glyph that takes both slopes honestly.
:math:`D_z` is the ISO 9613-2 barrier screening, whose *z* is the difference
between the diffracted and direct path lengths -- a quantity, italic -- and it
is the ISO 2631-5 acceleration dose, whose *z* names a direction -- upright.
Both documents print ``D_z``. Neither spelling is ours to change, so no single
corpus-wide slope for that pair can be right: one of the two modules would be
wrong by construction. Twenty pairs behave this way here.

So the unit of decision is the file, not the glyph. Each module opens with the
standard it implements and each guide with the standard it explains, so inside
one file a subscript has one meaning and therefore one slope. That is the
invariant this checks: **no file writes the same (base, subscript) pair both
ways.** Across files it says nothing, deliberately -- that is where the
legitimate duals live.

What a failure means, in order of how often it is the answer
------------------------------------------------------------

1. **One of the two is an index and can be re-lettered.** A subscript that
   runs over a sum is a bound variable: the letter is ours and means nothing
   outside the formula, while the colliding quantity's letter belongs to the
   standard that defines it. ``insulation.py`` energy-averages positions with
   :math:`\sum_i 10^{L_i/10}` and states ISO 16283-2's impact sound pressure
   level as :math:`L_\mathrm{i}`, on the same page. The index moved to *j*;
   the quantity could not move at all.
2. **One of the two lags.** The file already writes the settled slope
   elsewhere and one occurrence -- typically inside a plotting snippet, where
   the mathematics is a string inside a string -- was missed. Set it the way
   its neighbours are set.
3. **The page really does carry both meanings**, which is what a glossary is
   for. Register it in :data:`DECLARED`, naming both meanings. That list is
   meant to stay short: it is the escape hatch for a page whose subject is the
   collision, not a way to land one.

What this cannot check
----------------------

Whether the slope a file chose is the *right* one for its standard. That is a
reading of a source document, and no script does it. This gate only keeps a
file from asserting two answers at once, which is the failure a reader can see
without leaving the page.

Exit status 0 when every file is single-valued, 1 otherwise.
