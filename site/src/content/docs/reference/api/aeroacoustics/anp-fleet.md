EASA ANP fleet database bridge for the ECAC Doc 29 airport-noise chain.

The ECAC Doc 29 method in [`phonometry.aircraft.airport_noise`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/airport-noise/) places an
aircraft's noise at a receiver from a Noise-Power-Distance (NPD) table and a
flight profile. Both come, for real aircraft types, from the **Aircraft Noise
and Performance (ANP)** database maintained by EUROCONTROL/EASA: per aircraft it
tabulates NPD curves (`LAmax` and `SEL` versus slant distance for a set of
engine power settings, per operation mode) and default trajectories.

This module reads the ANP database tables (the semicolon-delimited CSV exports)
and exposes, for a given aircraft identifier and operation:

* [`AnpNpdCurves`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/anp-fleet/#anpnpdcurves) -- the NPD curves (`LAmax`/`SEL` versus distance for
  each tabulated power), with a `.plot()`;
* [`AnpProfile`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/anp-fleet/#anpprofile) -- the default fixed-point trajectory as a Doc 29 flight
  path `(N, 5)` with the takeoff/landing ground-roll masks, with a `.plot()`;
* [`AnpAircraft`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/anp-fleet/#anpaircraft) -- the aircraft metadata plus convenience wiring
  ([`AnpAircraft.event_level`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/anp-fleet/#anpaircraftevent_level), [`AnpAircraft.noise_contour`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/anp-fleet/#anpaircraftnoise_contour)) that feeds
  the NPD curves and the profile straight into the existing Doc 29 functions.

[`load_anp_database`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/anp-fleet/#load_anp_database) returns an [`AnpDatabase`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/anp-fleet/#anpdatabase). Called without a path
it loads the full EASA ANP database (archive version 2.3) shipped with the
package (see `aircraft/data/anp/PROVENANCE.md`); pointed at a directory it
reads any other ANP CSV export the user provides.

Aircraft whose default trajectory is published as *procedural steps* rather than
as fixed points are reached through [`phonometry.aircraft.flight_performance`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/flight-performance/),
the ECAC Doc 29 Vol. 2 Appendix B performance model:
[`AnpDatabase.flight_profile`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/anp-fleet/#anpdatabaseflight_profile) flies the published procedure for an
aerodrome and its weather, and [`AnpDatabase.procedural_profile`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/anp-fleet/#anpdatabaseprocedural_profile) returns the
result as the same Doc 29 flight path the fixed-point bridge produces, so either
kind of profile feeds the same chain. NPD curves are available for every aircraft
regardless.

database v2.3 (2020) and the ECAC Doc 29 4th ed. Vol 2 NPD/profile conventions.

| `stage_length` | ANP stage length (default 1). |
| `metric` | `"exposure"` (SEL) or `"maximum"` (LAmax). |
| `temperature` | Air temperature at the field, in °C, for the atmospheric impedance adjustment. Left unset it follows *aerodrome*, or the standard atmosphere when there is none. |

) -> FlightProfile
```

Fly an aircraft's published procedure into a Doc 29 flight profile.

The ECAC Doc 29 Vol. 2 Appendix B model applied to this aircraft's ANP
procedural steps: the profile depends on the aerodrome and its weather,
which is why one has to be given and why the answer is not a table entry.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `aircraft_id` | ANP aircraft identifier. |
| `operation` | `"departure"`/`"D"` or `"arrival"`/`"A"`. |

| `stage_length` | ANP stage length (default 1), which selects the take-off weight of a departure. |
| `profile_id` | Optional ANP profile identifier. |
| `weight_lb` | Weight to fly at, lb. `None` (default) takes the ANP default weight for the stage length on a departure, and 90 % of the maximum landing weight on an arrival, as Doc 29 defines it. |

**Returns:** A [`FlightProfile`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/flight-performance/#flightprofile).

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| KeyError | If the aircraft has no procedural-step profile or no default weight for the request. |

```

Doc 29 single-event ground contour of an ANP aircraft.

Feeds the aircraft's profile and NPD curves into

| :--- | :--- |
| `aircraft_id` | ANP aircraft identifier. |
| `operation` | `"departure"`/`"D"` or `"arrival"`/`"A"`. |
| `x` | Grid x coordinates (along-track), in metres. |
| `y` | Grid y coordinates (lateral), in metres. |
| `aerodrome` | Fly the published procedural steps at this field through the Appendix B performance model instead of reading the tabulated fixed-point trajectory. Most ANP types publish only steps, so for them this is not an alternative but the only way in. |
| `stage_length` | ANP stage length (default 1). |
| `metric` | `"exposure"` (SEL) or `"maximum"` (LAmax). |
| `temperature` | Air temperature at the field, in °C, for the atmospheric impedance adjustment. Left unset it follows *aerodrome*, or the standard atmosphere when there is none. |
| `pressure` | Air pressure at the field, in kPa, likewise. |

**Returns:** A [`NoiseContourResult`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/airport-noise/#noisecontourresult).

### AnpDatabase.npd_curves()

```python
AnpDatabase.npd_curves(
    aircraft_id: str,
    operation: str,
    metric: str = 'SEL',
) -> AnpNpdCurves
```

NPD curves for an aircraft, operation and noise metric.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |

| KeyError | If the aircraft has no NPD data for the request. |
| ValueError | If the metric or operation is unknown. |

### AnpDatabase.performance_aircraft()

```python
AnpDatabase.performance_aircraft(aircraft_id: str) -> PerformanceAircraft
```

The aeroplane's ECAC Doc 29 Vol. 2 Appendix B coefficient set.

Gathers the engine, aerodynamic and weight tables into the
[`PerformanceAircraft`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/flight-performance/#performanceaircraft) the
performance model takes. The engine count, the maximum sea-level static
thrust and the maximum landing weight come from the aircraft table; the
approach weight follows from the last of those as Doc 29 defines it.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `aircraft_id` | ANP aircraft identifier. |

**Returns:** A [`PerformanceAircraft`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/flight-performance/#performanceaircraft).

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| KeyError | If the aircraft is not in the database. |
| ValueError | If the export carries no performance tables at all, which is the case for an NPD-only export. |

### AnpDatabase.procedural_profile()

```python
AnpDatabase.procedural_profile(
    aircraft_id: str,
    operation: str,
    *,
    aerodrome: Aerodrome,
    stage_length: int | str = 1,
    profile_id: str | None = None,
    weight_lb: float | None = None,
) -> AnpProfile
```

A flown procedure as the flight path the Doc 29 noise chain reads.

`flight_profile` converted into the same [`AnpProfile`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/anp-fleet/#anpprofile) the
fixed-point bridge returns, so an aircraft that publishes procedural
steps and one that publishes fixed points feed
[`event_level`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/airport-noise/#event_level) and [`noise_contour`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/airport-noise/#noise_contour) alike. The units change on
the way (Appendix B works in feet, knots and pounds; the noise chain in
metres and metres per second) and the power setting stays the corrected
net thrust per engine the NPD tables are indexed on.

Takes the same arguments as `flight_profile`.

**Returns:** An [`AnpProfile`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/anp-fleet/#anpprofile).

### AnpDatabase.procedural_steps()

```python
AnpDatabase.procedural_steps(
    aircraft_id: str,
    operation: str,
    stage_length: int | str = 1,
    *,
    profile_id: str | None = None,
) -> tuple[DepartureStep, ...] | tuple[ApproachStep, ...]
```

The published procedure for an aircraft, as procedural steps.

The rows of the ANP departure or approach procedural-step table, in step
order, as the types
[`flight_performance`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/flight-performance/) flies. Approach
procedures are not tabulated per stage length, so `stage_length` is
read only for a departure.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `aircraft_id` | ANP aircraft identifier. |
| `operation` | `"departure"`/`"D"` or `"arrival"`/`"A"`. |
| `stage_length` | ANP stage length (default 1), departures only. |
| `profile_id` | Optional ANP profile identifier; `None` (default) selects `"DEFAULT"` when present, or the single available one. |

**Returns:** The steps, in order.

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| KeyError | If the aircraft has no procedural-step profile for the request, or `profile_id` is not among the available ones. |
| ValueError | If `profile_id` is `None` and several profiles exist with none of them named `"DEFAULT"`. |

### AnpDatabase.profile()

```python
AnpDatabase.profile(
    aircraft_id: str,
    operation: str,
    stage_length: int | str = 1,
    *,
    profile_id: str | None = None,
) -> AnpProfile
```

Fixed-point trajectory for an aircraft, operation and stage length.

Aircraft may ship several fixed-point profiles for the same operation
and stage length (e.g. weight variants). With `profile_id=None` the
`"DEFAULT"` profile is selected when present; otherwise the single
available profile is used, and an ambiguous request (several profiles,
none named `"DEFAULT"`) raises listing the identifiers.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `aircraft_id` | ANP aircraft identifier. |
| `operation` | `"departure"`/`"D"` or `"arrival"`/`"A"`. |
| `stage_length` | ANP stage length (default 1). |
| `profile_id` | Optional ANP profile identifier (e.g. `"DEFAULT"`, `"3000LB"`); `None` (default) selects as described above. |

**Returns:** An [`AnpProfile`](/phonometry/reference/api/aeroacoustics/anp-fleet/#anpprofile) (a Doc 29 flight path with ground-roll masks).

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| KeyError | If the aircraft is unknown, has no fixed-point profile for the request, or `profile_id` is not among the available ones. |
| ValueError | If `profile_id` is `None` and several profiles exist with none of them named `"DEFAULT"`. |

## AnpNpdCurves
