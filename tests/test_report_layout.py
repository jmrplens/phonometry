"""Tests for the shared fiche builders of :mod:`phonometry._report._layout`.

These are the pieces every accredited fiche is assembled from, so a defect in
one of them is latent in all of them whether or not a caller reaches it today.
Their contract is with the renderers rather than with a user, which is why it
is pinned here directly instead of through a ``report()`` call.
