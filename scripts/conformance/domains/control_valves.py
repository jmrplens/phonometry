"""Control valve aerodynamic noise (IEC 60534-8-3), against its own Annex A.

Annex A of IEC 60534-8-3:2010 is an unusually complete oracle: it prints six
operating points of one valve, one per flow regime with regime V used twice,
and it prints *every intermediate* of each of them beside the number of the
equation that produced it. A seventh example, on a different valve, prints the
transmission loss of its pipe in all 33 one-third-octave bands.

Oracle: Annex A, Table A.1 (printed folios 32 to 39, PDF pages 34 to 41) and
Table A.2 (printed folios 41 to 45, PDF pages 43 to 47) of
BS EN 60534-8-3:2011, which endorses IEC 60534-8-3:2010 without modification.

Two of the annex's printed values do not reproduce themselves, and the rows
below use the values that make it self-consistent:

* The piping geometry factor is printed ``F_p = 0,98``. Every one of the six
  printed vena contracta pressures needs ``0,984``: solving Equation (2) for
  ``(F_LP/F_P)^2`` from each printed pair gives 0,647 83 to five digits in all
  six columns, and that is ``F_p = 0,984``.
* The equivalent orifice diameter is printed ``d_o = 0,010`` m where
  Equation (8c) with the annex's own ``N_O = 6`` and ``A = 0,00137`` m² gives
  0,102 m. The ``F_d = 0,30`` printed on the next row is the ratio of the
  printed ``d_H = 0,030`` m to the larger value.

Both are in ``docs/ERRATA.md``.
