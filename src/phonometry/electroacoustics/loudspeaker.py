r"""Rated loudspeaker characteristics (IEC 60268-5).

A loudspeaker measurement/rating report gathers the *rated characteristics*
IEC 60268-5:2003+A1:2007 defines around a measured on-axis response: the
**characteristic sensitivity** referred to 1 W input at 1 m (clauses 20.3/20.4),
the **effective frequency range** read from the on-axis response against a
-10 dB band (clause 21.2), the **rated impedance** and its modulus curve
(clause 16), the **total harmonic distortion** against frequency (clause 24.1)
and the **directional / polar response** (clause 23). This module bundles those
into a single :class:`LoudspeakerCharacteristics` result whose ``report`` method
renders the IEC 60268-5 rated-characteristics fiche, with the characteristic
graphs laid out to the IEC 60263:1982 scale conventions.

Two of the rated characteristics are *computed* from the on-axis response so
the report never merely repeats a manufacturer number:

* **Characteristic sensitivity level** (20.3/20.4). The on-axis response is
  measured at a constant voltage ``U`` and distance ``d``; the sensitivity
  level referred to 1 W into the rated impedance ``R`` at 1 m is

  .. math::

     L_M = L_\text{band} + 20 \log_{10}(d / d_0) + 20 \log_{10}(U_\mathrm{p} / U),
     \qquad d_0 = 1\ \mathrm{m}

  where :math:`L_\text{band}` is the energetic mean of the on-axis level
  over a stated band (20.1.2.4: the r.m.s. of the band pressures) and
  :math:`U_\mathrm{p} = \sqrt{R P_0}` with :math:`P_0 = 1` W is the voltage that
  drives 1 W into ``R`` (20.3.2). With the default drive
  :math:`U = \sqrt{R}` at :math:`d = 1` m the two corrections vanish and
  the sensitivity level equals the band mean, which for :math:`R = 8` ohm
  is the familiar "dB / 2.83 V @ 1 m" figure. This is the clean-room
  oracle: a flat :math:`L_0` response driven at :math:`\sqrt{R}` volts
  and 1 m returns :math:`L_0` exactly, and a doubled voltage returns
  :math:`L_0 - 6.02` dB.

* **Effective frequency range** (21.2). The range of frequencies for which the
  on-axis response is not more than 10 dB below the level averaged over a
  one-octave band in the region of maximum sensitivity. Troughs narrower than
  1/9 octave at the -10 dB level are neglected. The band edges are the
  interpolated frequencies where the response last crosses the -10 dB
  threshold on either side of the peak, which is the second clean-room oracle:
  a response crossing the threshold at chosen frequencies returns exactly
  those frequencies.

    report.

    The characteristic sensitivity level (20.3/20.4) and the effective frequency
    range (21.2) are computed from the on-axis response; the optional impedance,
    distortion and directivity data feed the corresponding report panels.

    :param frequencies: On-axis response frequency axis, in Hz (1-D, > 0).
        Logarithmically spaced samples are strongly recommended: the band
        averages behind the sensitivity level and the effective-range
        reference weight each sample equally, so a linearly spaced grid
        over-weights the high-frequency end of every band.
    :param spl_db: On-axis sound pressure level, in dB re 20 uPa.
    :param rated_impedance: Rated impedance ``R``, in ohm (16.1).
    :param input_voltage: Constant drive voltage of the response, in V;
        defaults to :math:`\sqrt{R}` (1 W into ``R``, the 2.83 V @ 8 ohm
        convention).
    :param distance: Measuring distance of the response, in m (default 1).
    :param sensitivity_band: Stated band ``(lo, hi)`` for the characteristic
        sensitivity, in Hz; defaults to the one-octave band in the region of
        maximum sensitivity.
    :param tolerance_db: Half-width of the plotted response tolerance band, in
        dB (default 3).
    :param impedance: Impedance curve as ``(frequencies, modulus)`` in
        ``(Hz, ohm)`` (16.2).
    :param distortion: THD against frequency, either as a
        :class:`~phonometry.electroacoustics.SweptSineDistortionResult` (its
        ``thd`` ratio is converted to %) or a ``(frequencies, thd_percent)``
        pair (24.1).
    :param directivity: Directional characteristics of Clause 23 as a
        :class:`LoudspeakerDirectivity`: the pattern (measured or from a
        radiating piston), its stated frequency and the directivity index.
    :param ratings: Manufacturer-stated ratings of Clauses 18 and 19 as a
        :class:`LoudspeakerRatings`: the rated frequency range, the rated
        noise and sinusoidal powers and the resonance frequency.
    :return: A :class:`LoudspeakerCharacteristics`.
    :raises ValueError: If the inputs are invalid.
