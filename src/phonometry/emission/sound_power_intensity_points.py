r"""Sound power level of a noise source from sound intensity measured at
**discrete points**: ISO 9614-1:1993.

A p-p probe is held still at each of ``N`` points, one per segment of a
hypothetical surface enclosing the source, and reports the signed normal
intensity :math:`I_{\mathrm{n}i}` there. Each point stands for its segment, so
the partial power of the segment and the sound power of the source are
(clause 9.1 equation (11), clause 9.2 equation (12)):

.. math::

   P_i = I_{\mathrm{n}i} \, S_i \tag{Eq. 11}

   L_W = 10 \log_{10} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} P_i}{P_0}, \qquad
   P_0 = 10^{-12}~\text{W} \tag{Eq. 12}

Equation (12) prints without the absolute-value bars of the general definition
(equation (8)), because clause 9.2 disposes of the negative case instead: **the
method is not applicable to a band in which** :math:`\sum_i P_i` **is
negative**. A single segment may still carry negative power, and normally
does; that is energy flowing inward through part of the surface, which is what
:math:`F_3` exists to quantify, not an error to reject.

A.2.3 makes a second refusal, on a different quantity: where
:math:`\sum_i I_{\mathrm{n}i}` is not positive, "the test conditions do not
satisfy the requirements of this part of ISO 9614 in that frequency band". That sum is unweighted over the ``N`` positions, so equal
segments make the two refusals agree and unequal ones let them part company: a
band clause 9.2 keeps, with a positive total power and a finite level, can
still be one A.2.3 refuses. Both are reported, each in its own terms.

The sign lives in the print, not in the number. ISO 9614-1 writes a normal
intensity level as ``XX dB`` when the flow is outward and as ``(-) XX dB`` when
it is inward, ``XX`` being a positive number in both cases (clause 3.5, and the
two unnumbered equations of clauses 9.1 and A.2.3):

.. math::

   I_{\mathrm{n}i} = I_0 \times 10^{XX/10}, \qquad
   I_{\mathrm{n}i} = -I_0 \times 10^{XX/10}

with :math:`I_0 = 10^{-12}` W/m^2. :func:`normal_intensity_from_levels` takes
both forms; its ``negative`` argument is the ``(-)`` of the print.

The four Annex A field indicators come from
:func:`phonometry.emission.field_indicators`, which is written for this part of
ISO 9614 and averages over positions without area weighting, exactly as
equations (A.4), (A.5), (A.7) and (A.9) do. What this module adds is Annex B:
the qualification of the surface and of the position set, and what to change
when they do not qualify.

Annex B numbers **two** criteria, not three (B.1.1 and B.1.2). Figure B.1
gates the determination on four questions, in this order, and Table B.3 gives
the action to take when each fails:

.. math::

   F_1 \le 0.6 \quad\text{(Table B.3, action e)}

   \text{criterion 1:} \quad L_\mathrm{d} > F_2, \qquad
   L_\mathrm{d} = \delta_{pI0} - K \quad\text{(Eq. (B.1), actions a or b)}

   F_3 - F_2 \le 3~\text{dB} \quad\text{(Figure B.1, actions a or b)}

   \text{criterion 2:} \quad N > C F_4^2 \quad\text{(Eq. (B.2), actions c or d)}

The third gate is unnumbered in the print: it appears in Figure B.1 and shares
the second row of Table B.3 with criterion 1, and it is *not* a "criterion 3".
Only Figure B.1's first failing gate is acted on, because every action box in
the figure returns to the next measurement rather than to the gate below it, so
:meth:`DiscretePointIntensityResult.required_actions` reports one action set per
band and stops there.

**Grade 3 is an A-weighted determination only.** Table B.2 tabulates the
criterion-2 factor ``C`` for grades 1 and 2 band by band and gives grade 3 a
single A-weighted value (8) and no per-band column at all; Table B.1 does the
same with the error factor :math:`\Delta` (0,20 and 0,29 for all bands at
grades 1 and 2, 0,60 A-weighted at grade 3); and Table 2 does the same with the
standard deviation ``s`` of the determination. Three tables agree, so the
asymmetry is the standard's design and not a gap in it: a per-band
determination can reach grade 1 or grade 2, and grade 3 is reached, if at all,
by the A-weighted sum. Asking any of the three lookups here for a per-band
grade-3 figure raises rather than returning a plausible number.

The uncertainty of the determination is Table 2's ``s``, with footnote 1
placing the true value within :math:`\pm 2s` of the measured one at 95 %
confidence. Clause 10.6 says which row of the table to read it from: "the
grade of accuracy attained in the final test, according to table 2, shall
be stated", the grade **attained** and not the grade set out for, so a band
that only reached grade 2 carries the grade-2 figure even where grade 1 was asked
for. A band that fails criterion 2 may still be recorded, provided the 95 %
confidence interval of equation (B.3) accompanies it (B.1.2, clause 10.5 c)
and clause 10.6):

.. math::

   10 \log_{10}\!\left( 1 \pm \frac{2 F_4}{\sqrt{N}} \right)~\text{dB}
   \tag{Eq. B.3}

:func:`partial_power_concentration` is the optional procedure of clause 8.3.2
and B.1.3: where criterion 1 holds, criterion 2 does not and
:math:`F_3 - F_2 \le 1` dB, most of the power may pass through a minority of
the segments, and adding positions only there is cheaper than densifying the
whole surface. It is implemented because it is the only consumer of Table B.1
and because equation (B.4) is the standard's own answer to the commonest way a
discrete-point survey fails.

Two things this module does not do. It does not scan: the continuous sweep of
ISO 9614-2:1996 and ISO 9614-3:2002, whose indicators are area weighted and
whose criteria are numbered differently, is
:func:`phonometry.emission.sound_power_intensity`. And it does not grade the
instrument: :math:`\delta_{pI0}` is a property of the probe-spacer-analyser
chain, classified against IEC 61043:1993 Table 2 by
:func:`phonometry.emission.intensity_class_compliance`.

    A.2.3 refuses still has a perfectly good temporal variability. Measured on
    such a band, ``f1`` comes back finite while the other three are ``NaN``. A.2.3's refusal is not
    ``not_applicable_band``, whose quantity is clause 9.2's area-weighted sum,

    ``minimum_positions`` is the :math:`C F_4^2` that criterion 2 compares
    ``positions`` against.

    ``achieved_grade`` is the per-band grade, one of ``'precision'``,
    ``'engineering'`` and ``'none'``. Grade 3 is never among them: Table B.2
    gives it no per-band ``C``, so criterion 2 has no per-band form there and

    measures no spread ACROSS THE SURFACE, so there is no F2, F3 or F4 to
    report rather than a spectrum of blanks.

    Not "no Annex A indicators": F1 is one, and it survives. Equation (A.1) is
    the spread of the M short-time samples at ONE position over time, so a
    one-position determination has a perfectly good F1 beside three absent
    spatial indicators. That confusion has now been written into this module
    three times and corrected three times, which is why it is spelled out here
    rather than left to the reader: F1 is temporal, F2 to F4 are spatial, and
    every statement about "the indicators" has to say which it means.

    A.2.3 makes a non-positive algebraic mean normal intensity a failure of the
    test conditions in that band, and F3 and F4 both divide by that mean, so
    the three indicators are ``NaN`` there rather than raising: the refusal is
    scoped to the band ("en esa banda de frecuencia") and the other bands of
    the same determination stand.

    Being ``NaN`` is the whole of what these indicators can say about such a
    band, and it is not enough on its own, because the band need not be flagged
    anywhere else: guarding on the area-weighted sum of clause 9.2 instead
    would hand a column of negative mean to the coefficient of variation, which
    raises, but a band A.2.3 refuses can equally be one clause 9.2 keeps, with
    ``not_applicable_band`` false and a finite level beside it. So the
    determination announces the refusal itself; see
    :func:`sound_power_intensity_points`.

    F2 and F3 need the pressure levels and F4 does not, so a caller who
    measured only the intensity still gets the indicator criterion 2 is built
    on. Where the levels are present the three come from
    :func:`~phonometry.emission.field_indicators`, so this module and the

    band) of the signed normal intensity :math:`I_{\mathrm{n}i}` measured with
    the probe held still at each of the ``N`` points, and ``areas`` the
    ``(N,)`` areas :math:`S_i` of the segments those points stand for. The
    partial powers :math:`P_i = I_{\mathrm{n}i} S_i` (equation (11)) sum to the
    band sound power and its level :math:`L_W = 10 \lg(\sum_i P_i / P_0)`
    (equation (12)); a band whose sum is not positive is flagged
    ``not_applicable_band`` and reported as ``NaN``, the method not applying to
    it (clause 9.2).

    A single position may carry inward flow and usually does. Levels printed as
    ``(-) XX dB`` are converted by :func:`normal_intensity_from_levels`, whose
    ``negative`` argument is that ``(-)``.

    A.2.3 conditions the Annex A indicators on a different quantity, the
    unweighted mean of the ``N`` normal intensities, and makes a band whose
    mean is not positive a band in which the test conditions do not satisfy
    this part of ISO 9614. Its indicators come back ``NaN`` and the
    determination warns, because that band need not be flagged anywhere else:
    where the segments differ in area it can be a band clause 9.2 keeps, with a
    finite level and ``not_applicable_band`` false.

    Supplying ``pressure_levels`` evaluates the spatial Annex A indicators
    ``F2`` and ``F3``; ``F4`` is evaluated from the intensities alone. All
    three are spatial, so all three need at least two positions, which is the
    fewest equation (A.8) has a spread over, and all three are absent below
    that however much else was supplied. ``F1`` is the temporal one and does
    not take part in that: see ``temporal_intensity`` below. Supplying ``pressure_residual_index`` gives the dynamic
    capability :math:`L_\mathrm{d} = \delta_{pI0} - K` and criterion 1; supplying
    ``frequencies`` gives criterion 2 through the Table B.2 factor ``C`` and
    the A-weighted total. ``temporal_intensity`` carries the ``M`` short-time
    samples of the initial test into ``F1``.

    The requested ``grade`` selects ``K``, the omission rule of clause 10.5 b)
    and the tabulated factors; the grade each band actually reaches is reported
    per band in ``achieved_grade``, and for the A-weighted sum in
    ``achieved_grade_a``. The survey grade appears only in the latter, Table
    B.2 giving it no per-band ``C``. ``expanded_uncertainty`` follows the
    achieved grade rather than the requested one, which is the grade clause
    10.6 has a report state, so it needs everything ``achieved_grade`` needs.
