"""The glyph-outlining engine of the diagram plates.

The plates bake every label to glyph outlines at generation time, so the
committed artwork renders identically on every machine instead of falling
back to whatever sans-serif the viewer owns. This module is the whole
engine, isolated from the canvas: which font files exist
(:data:`_FACES`), how a string splits across them (:func:`segment`), how
wide it is (:func:`advance`), where each glyph lands (:func:`shape`),
the per-document outline atlas (:class:`GlyphStore`) and the writer that
turns styled runs into ``<g>``/``<use>`` markup (:func:`emit_runs`).

Two decisions carry the whole design. **One typeface across the drawn
corpus**: every face in :data:`_FACES` is a DejaVu face out of the
pinned matplotlib wheel, the same family and the same pin that sets the
figures, so a plate and a figure sitting on one documentation page are
set in one typeface instead of two. Nothing else fixes the plates'
metrics -- the compositions are held against these advances by the
canvas's fit gate and by the census below, and because this face runs
about 16 % wider than the Helvetica-metric one the corpus was composed
in, the plates' type scale is stated in its px and not in the old
face's (see :mod:`diagrams.canvas`). **Coverage is the chain**,
not the primary face: a glyph the primary lacks falls back per-cluster
to the next face, resolved deterministically at generation time --
which replaces the silent, machine-dependent fontconfig substitution
the live-text plates used to take. No face in the chain covering a
character is a hard error, never a blank.

Every face is loaded by file path; fontconfig is never consulted. All
measurement is the **pen advance** of the shaped string, never the ink
extents of a ``TextPath``: the ink box loses side bearings and eats the
boundary spaces that a fifth of the math runs begin or end with.

``python scripts/diagrams/outline.py --census`` measures every label of
every plate in both languages against its 900 px sheet and reports the
overhangs -- the permanent debugging tool behind the canvas's fit gate.
``--collisions`` measures the same labels against the drawings instead:
the panel a label sits in, the rules and circles the plate draws, and
the other labels on its line (see :func:`_collisions`).
