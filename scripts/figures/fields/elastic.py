    1D pre-validation (same dx, same 4-cell immersed plate, normal
    incidence): the measured transmission of a narrowband packet follows
    the library mass_law_transmission_loss within 0.07 dB at f_c / 2 and
    0.17 dB at 2 f_c (narrowband spectral amplitudes at the carrier;
    peak-amplitude estimates stay within 0.5 dB, limited by the packet's
    finite bandwidth), so the air-steel contrast is trusted at the -48 dB
    transmission this clip displays.

    Timeline per the animation norms: the frame step is 52 solver steps =
    8.52 us, i.e. 48.6 frames per period of the 2 f_c carrier (>= the 4 x
    12-frame visual minimum; four times that at f_c / 2), and the active
    span is the 0.62 ms source ramp plus 1.2 x the flight from the source
    line to the farthest visible point at the bottom of the view,
    (1.02 - 0.321) m / (c0 cos 45) = 2.88 ms -> 4.08 ms -> 479 active
    frames. Returns the two normalized frame stacks (incident amplitude
    = 1), the frame times, the measured transmitted levels [dB re
    incident] and the active frame count.
