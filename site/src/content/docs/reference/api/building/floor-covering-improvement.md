Impact-sound improvement of floor coverings on a small mock-up (ISO 16251-1:2014).

Laboratory method for the **improvement of impact sound insulation** `ΔL` of a
soft, locally-reacting floor covering (carpet, PVC, linoleum — ISO 10140-1
Annex H category I) laid on a small concrete mock-up plate and excited by a
standard tapping machine. The two rooms of the ISO 10140 series are removed and
the floor is replaced by a softly-supported concrete plate; instead of the
receiving-room sound pressure level, the **structure-borne acceleration level**
on the underside of the plate is measured with and without the covering. For
locally-reacting coverings this acceleration-level difference equals the ISO
10140 impact sound reduction (Clause 4).

**Acceleration level (Formula (1)).** `La = 10 lg[(1/Tm) ∫ a(t)²/a0² dt]` dB,
with the reference acceleration `a0 = 1e-6 m/s²` — i.e. `La = 10 lg(⟨a²⟩/a0²)`.

**Background correction (Formula (2)).** Each measured level `L'` is corrected
against the background `Lb` per accelerometer position, by the margin
`L' − Lb`: unchanged for `≥ 15 dB`; energy subtraction
`10 lg(10^(L'/10) − 10^(Lb/10))` for `6 ≤ margin < 15 dB`; and the fixed
`L' − 1,3 dB` limit for `< 6 dB`. Bands hitting the 1,3 dB limit are flagged
as the *limit of measurement* (reported as `> ΔL`). This differs from the ISO
10140-4 correction ([`phonometry.background_correction`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/lab-insulation/#background_correction)) only at exactly
`margin = 6 dB`.

**Improvement (Formulae (3)/(4)).** The per-position difference is
`ΔLt,a = L0,t,a − L1,t,a` (0 = bare plate, 1 = specimen) and the improvement is
their arithmetic mean over all tapping-machine (t) and accelerometer (a)
positions, `ΔL = (1/(t·a)) Σt Σa ΔLt,a`.

**Octave bands (Formula (5)).** `ΔLoct = −10 lg[(1/3) Σ 10^(−ΔL_n/10)]` dB from
the three one-third-octave values in each octave.

**Weighted improvement.** `ΔLw` is the ISO 717-2 weighted reduction of impact
sound pressure level (Clause 6.5), computed with the heavyweight reference floor
via [`phonometry.weighted_impact_improvement`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#weighted_impact_improvement) on the 16 rating bands
100 Hz to 3150 Hz — a wider clause 6.3 spectrum (18 bands 100-5000 Hz,
optionally extended to 50 Hz) is rated on that sub-range. The statement of
results (Clause 8 e)) also carries the spectrum adaptation term `CI,Δ`
(ISO 717-2:2020 Formula (A.4)) via
[`phonometry.impact_improvement_adaptation_term`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#impact_improvement_adaptation_term).

## acceleration_level

```python
acceleration_level(
    acceleration: float | Sequence[float] | np.ndarray,
    *,
    reference: float = 1e-06,
) -> np.ndarray
```

Vibratory acceleration level `La` (ISO 16251-1 Formula (1)).

`La = 10 lg(a_rms² / a0²) = 20 lg(a_rms / a0)` dB.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `acceleration` | RMS acceleration `a_rms` per band, in m/s² (> 0). |
| `reference` | Reference acceleration `a0`, in m/s² (default 1e-6). |

**Returns:** The acceleration level `La` per band, in dB.

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | Non-finite or non-positive acceleration, or a non-positive reference. |

## background_corrected_level

```python
background_corrected_level(
    signal_and_background: float | Sequence[float] | np.ndarray,
    background: float | Sequence[float] | np.ndarray,
) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]
```

Correct a measured level for background noise (ISO 16251-1 Formula (2)).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `signal_and_background` | Measured level `L'` (with background) per band, in dB. |
| `background` | Background-noise level `Lb` per band, in dB. |

**Returns:** `(corrected, limited)` — the corrected levels `L` per band, in dB, and a boolean mask of bands at the 1,3 dB limit of measurement (report as `> ΔL`).

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | Mismatched shapes or non-finite values. |

## FloorCoveringImprovementResult

```python
FloorCoveringImprovementResult(
    frequencies: np.ndarray,
    improvement: np.ndarray,
    limited: np.ndarray,
    delta_lw: int | None,
    ci_delta: int | None = None,
)
```

Impact-sound improvement of a floor covering (ISO 16251-1).

**Attributes**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `frequencies` | One-third-octave band centre frequencies, in Hz. |
| `improvement` | Improvement of impact sound insulation `ΔL` per band, in dB. |
| `limited` | Per-band boolean mask of bands at the 1,3 dB limit of measurement (reported as `> ΔL`); all `False` when no background correction was applied. |
| `delta_lw` | Weighted improvement `ΔLw` (ISO 717-2), in dB, or `None` when the spectrum does not contain the 16 one-third-octave rating bands 100-3150 Hz. A wider clause 6.3 spectrum (e.g. the 18 bands 100-5000 Hz, optionally extended down to 50 Hz) is rated on its 100-3150 Hz sub-range. |
| `ci_delta` | Spectrum adaptation term `CI,Δ` (ISO 717-2:2020 Formula (A.4); required in the ISO 16251-1 Clause 8 e) statement of results), in dB, or `None` when `delta_lw` is `None`. |

### FloorCoveringImprovementResult.octave_bands()

```python
FloorCoveringImprovementResult.octave_bands() -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]
```

Return `(octave_freqs, ΔLoct)` via Formula (5) (needs 16 1/3-oct bands).

### FloorCoveringImprovementResult.plot()

```python
FloorCoveringImprovementResult.plot(
    ax: Axes | None = None,
    *,
    language: str = 'en',
    **kwargs: Any,
) -> Axes
```

Plot the improvement spectrum `ΔL` (with `ΔLw` when available).

Requires matplotlib (`pip install phonometry[plot]`); returns the
`Axes`.

## impact_improvement

```python
impact_improvement(
    bare: float | Sequence[float] | np.ndarray,
    with_covering: float | Sequence[float] | np.ndarray,
    frequencies: float | Sequence[float] | np.ndarray,
    *,
    background: float | Sequence[float] | np.ndarray | None = None,
) -> FloorCoveringImprovementResult
```

Improvement of impact sound insulation `ΔL` of a floor covering (ISO 16251-1).

The acceleration levels without (`L0`) and with (`L1`) the specimen may be
given either as one value per band (already averaged over the tapping-machine
and accelerometer positions) or, for the raw measurement, as a
`(positions, bands)` array. The standard's order of operations is followed:
the background correction (Formula (2)) is applied **per position**, then the
level difference `ΔLt,a = L0 − L1` (Formula (3)), then the arithmetic mean
over positions `ΔL = mean(ΔLt,a)` (Formula (4)) — necessary because Formula
(2) is non-linear, so correcting must precede averaging.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `bare` | Bare-plate acceleration level `L0`, in dB — `(bands,)` or `(positions, bands)`. |
| `with_covering` | Level with the specimen `L1`, in dB — same shape as `bare`. |
| `frequencies` | One-third-octave band centre frequencies, in Hz (`(bands,)`). |
| `background` | Optional background-noise level `Lb`, in dB — `(bands,)` (applied to every position) or `(positions, bands)`. When given, `L0` and `L1` are background-corrected (Formula (2)) per position before the difference, and bands where any position hits the 1,3 dB limit are flagged. |

**Returns:** [`FloorCoveringImprovementResult`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/floor-covering-improvement/#floorcoveringimprovementresult) (`ΔL` per band).

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | Mismatched shapes or non-finite values. |

## improvement_octave_bands

```python
improvement_octave_bands(
    improvement: Sequence[float] | np.ndarray,
    frequencies: Sequence[float] | np.ndarray,
) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]
```

Convert a one-third-octave improvement spectrum to octaves (Formula (5)).

`ΔLoct = −10 lg[(1/3) Σ_{n=1..3} 10^(−ΔL_n/10)]` dB over the three thirds of
each octave.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `improvement` | Improvement `ΔL` per one-third-octave band, in dB. |
| `frequencies` | The matching one-third-octave centre frequencies, in Hz; must contain whole octave triplets (centre / centre·2^(±1/3)). |

| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | The thirds do not group into complete octave triplets. |
