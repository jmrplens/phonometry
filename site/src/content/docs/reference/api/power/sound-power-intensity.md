Sound power level of a noise source by sound-intensity **scanning**:
ISO 9614-2:1996 (engineering, grade 2; survey/control, grade 3).

A probe is swept continuously over each segment of a hypothetical surface that
encloses the source, reporting the time-averaged signed normal intensity
`<In,i>` and mean-square pressure per segment. The sound power follows from the
partial powers `Pi = <In,i>*Si` summed over the `N` segments (clause 9,
equations (5), (6), (12), (13)):

```text
Pi = <In,i> * Si                       (partial power, Eq. 12)
P  = sum_i Pi                          (total power, Eq. 6)
LW = 10*lg(P/P0),  P0 = 1e-12 W        (sound power level, Eq. 13)
```

The method is **not applicable to any band in which P \< 0** (clause 9.2): a
strong parasitic source outside the surface makes the net energy flow inward and
the determination invalid for that band.

Two scanning-method field indicators qualify the determination (Annex A,
normative):

```text
FpI  = [Lp] - LW + 10*lg(S/S0)                       (Eq. A.1)
[Lp] = 10*lg( (1/S) * sum_i Si*10^(0,1*Lpi) )        (area-weighted surface SPL)
F+/- = 10*lg( sum_i |Pi| / |sum_i Pi| )              (Eq. A.2)
```

`FpI` is the surface pressure-intensity indicator (equivalent to ISO 9614-1
`F3` for uniform-area segments, Note 14); `F+/-` the negative-partial-power
indicator (equivalent to ISO 9614-1 `F3-F2`, Note 15). Because Part 2 weights
by segment area `Si` while [`phonometry.field_indicators`](/phonometry/reference/api/power/intensity/#field_indicators) (ISO 9614-1)
assumes equal-area positions, the indicators are computed directly here; only
the dynamic-capability index `Ld = delta_pI0 - K` is shared with
[`phonometry.dynamic_capability_index`](/phonometry/reference/api/power/intensity/#dynamic_capability_index).

Qualification criteria per band (Annex B):

```text
criterion 1:  Ld > FpI        Ld = delta_pI0 - K  (K = 10 eng / 7 survey, Table 1)
criterion 2:  F+/- <= 3 dB    (mandatory grade 2; optional grade 3)
criterion 3:  |LWi(1) - LWi(2)| <= s   per segment  (s from Table 2)
```

A band achieves the **engineering** grade when criteria 1, 2 and 3 hold, the
**survey** grade when criteria 1 and 3 hold (clause 8.4), otherwise none.

## sound_power_intensity

```python
sound_power_intensity(
    normal_intensity: np.ndarray,
    areas: np.ndarray,
    *,
    normal_intensity_2: np.ndarray | None = None,
    pressure_levels: np.ndarray | None = None,
    pressure_residual_index: float | np.ndarray | None = None,
    frequencies: np.ndarray | None = None,
    band_type: BandType = 'third',
    grade: Grade = 'engineering',
    repeatability_limit: float | np.ndarray | None = None,
) -> SoundPowerIntensityResult
```

Sound power level by sound-intensity scanning (ISO 9614-2:1996).

`normal_intensity` is an `(N_seg, N_bands)` array (or `(N_seg,)` for a
single band) of the signed, segment-averaged normal sound intensity
`<In,i>` (W/m^2), and `areas` the `(N_seg,)` segment areas `Si`
(m^2). The partial powers `Pi = <In,i>*Si` are summed to the band sound
power `P` and level `LW = 10*lg(P/P0)` (equations (12), (6), (13)). Bands
with `P < 0` are flagged (`negative_band`) and reported as `NaN`
(clause 9.2).

Supplying `normal_intensity_2` (the second grade-2 sweep) makes
`normal_intensity` the first sweep, uses their mean for the partial powers
(Eq. 12), and evaluates the repeatability criterion 3. Supplying
`pressure_levels` (`Lpi`) evaluates `FpI` (Eq. A.1) and, with
`pressure_residual_index` (`delta_pI0`), criterion 1. The per-band
achieved grade (clause 8.4) is returned when both a second sweep and
`delta_pI0` are available.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `normal_intensity` | `(N_seg, N_bands)` signed normal intensity, W/m^2. |
| `areas` | `(N_seg,)` segment areas `Si`, m^2. |
| `normal_intensity_2` | Optional second sweep, same shape (criterion 3). |
| `pressure_levels` | Optional `(N_seg, N_bands)` `Lpi` (dB) for FpI. |
| `pressure_residual_index` | `delta_pI0` (dB), scalar or per band, for the dynamic-capability index / criterion 1. |
| `frequencies` | `(N_bands,)` nominal band centres (Hz), for the A-weighted total and the Table 2 repeatability limits. |
| `band_type` | `'octave'` or `'third'` (Table 2 lookup). |
| `grade` | `'engineering'` (grade 2) or `'survey'` (grade 3); selects `K` for the reported `Ld` and the criterion-2 warning. |
| `repeatability_limit` | Override for the criterion-3 limit `s` (dB), scalar or per band; defaults to ISO 9614-2 Table 2 by `frequencies` for `'engineering'`. For `'survey'` the default is the A-weighted 4 dB reused per band (extrapolated -- non-normative). |

**Returns:** [`SoundPowerIntensityResult`](/phonometry/reference/api/power/sound-power-intensity/#soundpowerintensityresult).

## SoundPowerIntensityResult

```python
SoundPowerIntensityResult(
    frequencies: np.ndarray | None,
    partial_power: np.ndarray,
    partial_power_level: np.ndarray,
    sound_power: np.ndarray,
    sound_power_level: np.ndarray,
    negative_band: np.ndarray,
    surface_pressure_intensity_index: np.ndarray | None,
    negative_partial_power_index: np.ndarray | None,
    repeatability: np.ndarray | None,
    dynamic_capability_index: np.ndarray | None,
    achieved_grade: np.ndarray | None,
    surface_area: float,
    sound_power_level_a: float,
    grade: str,
)
```

Result of an ISO 9614-2:1996 sound-power-by-scanning determination.

`partial_power` is the signed `Pi = <In,i>*Si` per segment and band
(Eq. 12); `partial_power_level` the magnitude level `10*lg(|Pi|/P0)`
(Eq. 8), with the sign carried by `partial_power`. `sound_power` is the
signed band total `P = sum Pi` (Eq. 6) and `sound_power_level` its level
`10*lg(P/P0)` (Eq. 13), `NaN` where `P <= 0` (`negative_band` True,
method not applicable, clause 9.2). `surface_pressure_intensity_index`
(FpI, Eq. A.1) and `negative_partial_power_index` (F+/-, Eq. A.2) are
per band, `None` when the inputs they need are absent. `repeatability`
is `|LWi(1)-LWi(2)|` per segment and band (criterion 3), `None` without
a second scan; it is `+inf` where the two sweeps reverse the flow
direction on a segment (opposite-sign partial powers), a gross
non-repeatability that criterion 3 must reject even when the magnitudes
happen to match. `dynamic_capability_index` is `Ld` for the requested
grade. `achieved_grade` is the per-band class `'engineering'`/
`'survey'`/`'none'` (clause 8.4), `None` when the qualifying inputs
(`delta_pI0` and a second scan) are absent. `sound_power_level_a` is the
A-weighted total over determinable bands (`NaN` without `frequencies`
and more than one band).

### SoundPowerIntensityResult.plot()

```python
SoundPowerIntensityResult.plot(
    ax: Axes | None = None,
    *,
    language: str = 'en',
    **kwargs: Any,
) -> Axes
```

Plot the LW spectrum; non-positive bands are hatched as unusable.

Requires matplotlib (`pip install phonometry[plot]`); returns the
`Axes`.

### SoundPowerIntensityResult.report()

```python
SoundPowerIntensityResult.report(
    path: str,
    *,
    metadata: ReportMetadata | None = None,
    engine: str = 'reportlab',
    verbose: bool = False,
    language: str = 'en',
) -> str
```

Render an ISO 9614-2 sound-power-by-intensity determination fiche.

Writes a one-page sound-power test sheet: the standard-basis line naming
the intensity-scanning method and its measurement grade (ISO 9614-2:1996
engineering grade 2 or survey grade 3), an optional metadata header
(client, noise source, test environment, instrumentation, climate,
date), a per-band table (nominal octave/one-third-octave frequency and
the intensity-derived band sound-power level `LW`), the sound-power
spectrum `LW(f)` with net-negative bands hatched as unusable, the
boxed A-weighted sound power level `LWA` (dB re 1 pW) with the total
`LW`, the measurement surface area `S` and the determination grade,
an optional verdict row against a declared limit, and a
measurement-basis strip stating the partial-power model, the field
indicators (`FpI`, `F+/-`) and the Annex B qualification criteria.
