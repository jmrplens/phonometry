    Calculate the calibration factor (multiplier) to convert digital units
    to Pascals based on a reference recording (e.g., 1kHz @ 94dB).

    When ``fs`` is provided (and ``validate`` is True), the recording's
    stability is checked the way IEC 60942:2017 specifies for the calibrator
    itself (5.3.3): levels are measured with time-weighting F and the
    *short-term level fluctuation* — the absolute difference between each of
    the maximum and minimum levels and the mean level — must not exceed the
    Table 2 acceptance limit for the calibrator class (class 1: 0.07 dB at
    and above 160 Hz, relaxed to 0.10 dB below 160 Hz and 0.20 dB at or below 63 Hz
    because the F time-weighting itself ripples at low frequencies). A larger
    fluctuation usually means a badly coupled microphone or handling noise in
    the recording, which would silently corrupt every calibrated level; a
    :class:`CalibrationWarning` is emitted.

    .. note:: IEC 60942 certifies calibrators over 60 s of operation sampled
       at least 30 times; this check applies the same criterion to whatever
       settled portion of the recording is available (>= 1 s after the 1 s
       integrator attack).

    :param ref_signal: Recording of the calibration tone.
    :param target_spl: The known SPL level of the calibrator (default 94 dB).
    :param ref_pressure: Reference pressure (default 20 microPascals).
    :param fs: Sample rate of the recording in Hz. Required for the
        stability validation; without it the check is skipped.
    :param validate: If True (default) and ``fs`` is given, warn when the
        recording's short-term level fluctuation exceeds the limit.
    :param max_fluctuation_db: Explicit fluctuation limit in dB. Default
        (None) resolves the IEC 60942:2017 Table 2 class 1 limit for
        ``frequency``.
    :param frequency: Nominal frequency of the calibration tone in Hz
        (default 1000.0), used to select the Table 2 row.
    :param narrowband: If True (requires ``fs``), estimate the tone level with
        a coherent single-frequency (Goertzel) detector locked to the tone
        near ``frequency`` instead of the full-band RMS. This rejects
        broadband hum/noise in the reference take, which otherwise inflates
        the RMS and shrinks the factor by ``-10*lg(1 + 1/SNR)`` (about
        -0.44 dB at 20 dB SNR), silently biasing every subsequent level.
        The default (False) keeps the exact legacy broadband-RMS behaviour;
        enable it for noisy coupler recordings.
