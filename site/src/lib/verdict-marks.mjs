/**
 * The conformance verdict marks, inlined into the page as an SVG sprite.
 *
 * The same four files GitHub reads over `raw.githubusercontent.com`
 * (`.github/badges/verdict-*.svg`, written by `scripts/conformance_badges.py`),
 * read off disk at build time and turned into `<symbol>` definitions.
 *
 * **Inlined, not fetched, and the reason is arithmetic.** The report draws a
 * mark on every one of 566 rows. Fetched, that is 566 `<img>` elements against
 * one cached file: cheap on the network, but every one of them is a layout box
 * that arrives late, and each carries an `alt` a screen reader announces
 * beside a word the row already states. Copying the file into every row is
 * worse: at 319 bytes for the smallest of the four that is 176 kB of markup.
 * A sprite is neither. Measured on the built page, the geometry costs 1002
 * bytes once and a row spends 149 on the `<svg><use>` that points at it, so
 * 566 rows come to 82 kB with no request and no flash, and the marks are in
 * the HTML that Pagefind indexes and that a reader without JavaScript sees.
 *
 * The fills come across unchanged. They were chosen against every ground the
 * marks land on at once - GitHub's three canvases and two table stripes, and
 * this site's own two page colours (`#ffffff` and `#0d1114`, because
 * `src/styles/theme.css` overrides Starlight's `--sl-color-black`) and two
 * card colours - precisely so that one file is right in every theme, and
 * `tests/test_conformance_badges.py` measures all nine rather than asserting
 * them, GitHub's dimmed table stripe included, which is the single ground the
 * fills fall short on and the one place that test names an exception. So
 * there is nothing here to re-theme, and re-theming would fork a palette that
 * is currently measured in one place.
 *
 * Read from the repository rather than copied into `public/`: a copy is a
 * second thing to keep in step, and `scripts/stage-media.mjs` exists for the
 * figures because those are megabytes, which these are not.
