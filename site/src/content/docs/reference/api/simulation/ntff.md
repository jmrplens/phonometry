2D near-to-far-field (NTFF) transformation over a closed contour.

Given the steady-state pressure and outward normal velocity phasors on a
closed contour that encloses a scatterer (or any source region), the
exterior field is fully determined by the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz boundary
integral. In two dimensions, with the $e^{+j \omega t}$ time
convention
used throughout the library, the free-space Green function is

$$
G(R) = -(j / 4)\, H_0^{(2)}(k R),
$$

with $H_0^{(2)}$ the Hankel function of the second kind (outgoing
waves) and
`R` the source-observer distance, and the exterior representation reads

$$
p(r) = \oint_S \left[ p(r')\, dG/dn' + j \omega \rho\, v_n(r')\, G \right] dl',
$$

where `n'` is the outward normal of the contour `S` and the momentum
equation $dp/dn = -j \omega \rho v_n$ eliminated the pressure
gradient. The
normal derivative of the Green function brings in $H_1^{(2)}$:
$dG/dR = (j k / 4) H_1^{(2)}(k R)$. This is the same construction
full-wave
solvers use to report far-field scattering patterns from near-field data
(e.g. the finite-element polar responses of Jimenez, Cox, Romero-Garcia
and Groby, *Metadiffusers: Deep-subwavelength sound diffusers*, Sci. Rep.
7, 5389, 2017); the classical background is Williams, *Fourier Acoustics*
(Academic Press, 1999), chapter 8.

[`far_field_from_contour`](/phonometry/reference/api/simulation/ntff/#far_field_from_contour) evaluates that integral for phasors captured
by `add_contour_probe` (or assembled by
hand into a [`ContourPhasors`](/phonometry/reference/api/simulation/ntff/#contourphasors)), either in the true far-field limit,
where
$H_0^{(2)}(kR) \to \sqrt{2 / (\pi k R)}\, e^{-j (k R - \pi / 4)}$
turns the
integral into an angular pattern $F(\theta)$ with
$p(r, \theta) \to F(\theta)\, e^{-j k r} / \sqrt{r}$, or at a finite
observation radius with the exact Hankel kernels.

Because the integral representation is source-free inside `S` for any
field whose sources lie outside the contour, the incident wave of a
scattering run contributes (analytically) nothing to the exterior integral:
transforming total-field phasors already yields the scattered far field.
Subtracting a reference run without the scatterer
([`ContourPhasors.subtract`](/phonometry/reference/api/simulation/ntff/#contourphasorssubtract)) removes the residual of that cancellation
caused by grid dispersion; on the validation scenes the residual stays
below 0.01 dB, so the subtraction is optional in practice.

Validated against analytic oracles: the omnidirectional pattern and the
absolute level of a monopole line source reconstructed from an enclosing
contour, the null pattern of an antiphase source pair, the extinction of a
contour that does not enclose the source, and the far-field polar response
of meshed Schroeder-type diffusers against the library's Fraunhofer model
(`tests/simulation/test_fdtd_ntff.py`).

## ContourPhasors

```python
ContourPhasors(
    frequency: float,
    positions: NDArray[np.float64],
    normals: NDArray[np.float64],
    pressure: NDArray[np.complex128],
    normal_velocity: NDArray[np.complex128],
    segment: float,
)
```

Steady-state `p` and `v_n` phasors sampled on a closed contour.

The phasors follow the library's $e^{+j \omega t}$ convention:
$p(t) = \operatorname{Re}\{p \, e^{+j \omega t}\}$.
`normals` point outward
(away from the enclosed region) and `normal_velocity` is the particle
velocity component along them. Instances are produced by
`add_contour_probe` probes; they can
also be assembled by hand from any solver's near field.

**Attributes**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `frequency` | Frequency of the phasors [Hz]. |
| `positions` | Sample positions `(x, y)` [m], shape `(n, 2)`. |
| `normals` | Outward unit normals, shape `(n, 2)`. |
| `pressure` | Complex pressure phasor at each sample [Pa]. |
| `normal_velocity` | Complex outward normal velocity phasor [m/s]. |
| `segment` | Contour length carried by each sample `dl` [m]. |

### ContourPhasors.subtract()

```python
ContourPhasors.subtract(reference: ContourPhasors) -> ContourPhasors
```

Phasor difference on the same contour: `self - reference`.

The standard way to isolate the scattered field of a plane-wave
scattering run: capture the same contour in a second, otherwise
identical simulation without the scatterer and subtract its
(incident-only) phasors. Geometry and frequency must match.

## far_field_from_contour

```python
far_field_from_contour(
    contour: ContourPhasors,
    angles: ArrayLike,
    *,
    distance: float | None = None,
    origin: tuple[float, float] = (0.0, 0.0),
    fluid: Fluid = ...,
) -> NDArray[np.complex128]
```

Exterior field of a closed contour: the 2D Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral.

Evaluates, for each observation angle `a` (degrees, measured from the
`+x` axis towards `+y` of the grid coordinates, so the unit
direction is $u = (\cos a, \sin a)$),

$$
p(r) = \oint_S \left[ p\, dG/dn' + j \omega \rho\, v_n G \right] dl'
$$

with the outgoing 2D free-space Green function
$G = -(j/4) H_0^{(2)}(k R)$ and its normal derivative through
$dG/dR = (j k / 4) H_1^{(2)}(k R)$ ($e^{+j \omega t}$
convention,
`scipy.special.hankel2`).

With `distance=None` (the default) the far-field limit
$H_0^{(2)}(kR) \to \sqrt{2 / (\pi k R)}\, e^{-j (k R - \pi/4)}$
is taken
analytically and the returned complex pattern $F(a)$ is the
relative
far-field amplitude defined by

$$
p(r, a) \to F(a)\, e^{-j k r} / \sqrt{r} \quad \text{as } r \to \infty,
$$

with `r` measured from `origin` (the phase reference; magnitudes at
infinity do not depend on it). With a finite `distance` the exact
Hankel kernels are used instead and the return value is the complex
pressure [Pa] on the circle of that radius around `origin` (which must
lie outside the contour samples).

For radiating problems the contour must enclose every source of the
field being transformed. For scattering runs (scatterer enclosed,
incident source outside) the incident field integrates to nothing, so
total-field phasors transform directly into the scattered far field;
subtracting a no-scatterer reference ([`ContourPhasors.subtract`](/phonometry/reference/api/simulation/ntff/#contourphasorssubtract))
is optional numerical cleanup of the grid-dispersion residual of that
cancellation (below 0.01 dB on the validation scenes).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `contour` | The contour phasors (from `add_contour_probe`, or hand built). |
| `angles` | Observation angles [degrees], 1D. `0` is `+x`, `90` is `+y` of the coordinates `contour.positions` live in. |
| `distance` | Observation radius [m] for the exact evaluation, or `None` (default) for the far-field pattern. |
| `origin` | Phase-reference point `(x, y)` [m]; the centre of the observation circle when `distance` is given. Default the grid origin. |
| `fluid` | The medium, a [`Fluid`](/phonometry/reference/api/fluids/fluids/#fluid) (Default: [`SIMULATION_AIR`](/phonometry/reference/api/simulation/ntff/#simulation_air), the air this package's solvers run in). |

**Returns:** Complex array, one value per angle: the far-field pattern `F(a)` (units Pa sqrt(m)), or the pressure [Pa] at `distance`.

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | For invalid angles, a non-positive `distance`, or an observation circle that does not clear the contour. |

## SIMULATION_AIR

*Constant* (`phonometry.fluids.Fluid`).
