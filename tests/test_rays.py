r"""Tests for the shared range-marching ray core, ``phonometry._internal.rays``.

The oracles for the ray-tube spreading are geometry and nothing else. Two are
closed forms derived below; the third is the Jacobian of the ray family itself,
finite-differenced from traced ray paths, which is what :math:`q` is *defined*
to be (Jensen Eq. 3.64) and so is independent of every line the marcher runs;
the fourth integrates the smooth form of the equations with SciPy on a profile
the marcher can only approximate, which is what pins the impulsive treatment of
a piecewise-linear profile's second derivative; and the fifth is that same
Jacobian read off a family written in closed form, circular arcs inside a
gradient layer and straight lines above the homogeneous cap on top of it, which
carries no discretisation error of its own and so can be aimed at the crossings
the marcher resolves least well.

The closed forms. In a range-independent medium the pair obeys
:math:`dq/dr = p/\xi` and :math:`dp/dr = -\xi\,c''(z)\,q/c(z)`, so wherever the
profile has no curvature, :math:`p` keeps its launch value and :math:`q` is a
straight line in range. With the geometric initial conditions of Eq. (3.63),
:math:`q(0) = 0` and :math:`p(0) = 1/c(z_\mathrm{s})`, that is

.. math::

    q(r) = \frac{r\,p(0)}{\xi} = \frac{r}{c(z_\mathrm{s})\,\xi}
         = \frac{r}{\cos\theta_0},

for an isovelocity medium and, less obviously, for a constant gradient too:
the rays there are circular arcs of radius :math:`1/(|g|\xi)`, yet
:math:`c'' = 0` all the same, so the spreading in *range* is the same straight
line and the gradient never enters. Working it out from the arc confirms it.
Writing :math:`a = c(z_\mathrm{s})/g` and putting the arc through the source,

.. math::

    z(r) = z_c + \sqrt{a^2\sec^2\theta_0 - (r - a\tan\theta_0)^2},

so :math:`\partial z/\partial\theta_0 = a\sec^2\theta_0\,r/(z - z_c)` at fixed
range, and with :math:`z - z_c = c(z)/g` the Jacobian relation
:math:`q = c\,\xi\,\partial z/\partial\theta_0` returns :math:`r\sec\theta_0`
exactly, gradient and all cancelled.

That Jacobian relation is the third oracle and worth deriving once. The
Jacobian of Eq. (3.64) is the three-dimensional one, :math:`r\,q = J`, whose
azimuthal factor is the :math:`r`; what is left is
:math:`J_{2D} = \det\partial(r,z)/\partial(s,\theta_0)`, and expanding it with
:math:`\partial r/\partial s = c\xi` and :math:`\partial z/\partial s = c\zeta`
the two terms in :math:`\partial r/\partial\theta_0` cancel, leaving

.. math::

    q = c(z)\,\xi\,\left.\frac{\partial z}{\partial\theta_0}\right|_r .

In a homogeneous medium that is :math:`\cos\theta_0 \cdot r\sec^2\theta_0 = s`,
which is the arclength, as it must be. A reflection flips the sign of the
derivative of the *folded* depth without touching :math:`q` (Eq. 3.122), so the
comparison carries a factor :math:`(-1)^{\text{bounces}}`.
