"""Deprecated module-path aliases for the phonometry package layout.

Two generations of aliases live here, each with its own removal date:

* :data:`_MOVED_3X` covers the 3.2 modularization, which grouped the flat
  top-level modules into domain subpackages (``phonometry.building``,
  ``phonometry.underwater``, ...). Removed in 4.0. Its targets follow the
  modules wherever they land, so a 3.x path always resolves in one hop.
* :data:`_MOVED_4X` covers the 4.0 taxonomy, which splits the oversized
  subpackages into domain ones (``phonometry.metrology`` into
  ``phonometry.filters``, ``phonometry.signals`` and a narrowed
  ``phonometry.metrology``). Removed in 5.0.

Every public module path that moved stays importable through the shims
registered here: ``import phonometry.<old>`` and ``from phonometry.<old>
import name`` keep working, warn with the standard rename notice on attribute
access, and delegate to the relocated module. Pickles produced by an earlier
release (whose classes carry old ``__module__`` paths) resolve the same way.

The 4.0 split also moves names *between* subpackage namespaces, and importing
the domain namespace (``from phonometry import metrology``) is the form the
documentation leads with. :func:`_namespace_shim` keeps those attribute reads
working from the namespace they left, with the same notice.

This generalizes the former ``phonometry.loudness`` PEP 562 shim (that module
file is gone; its entry lives in the table below with its original 3.1 wording
preserved).
