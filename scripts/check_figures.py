"""Tolerance-aware staleness check for the committed documentation figures.

The ``Documentation figures up to date`` CI job regenerates ``.github/images``
with ``make graphs`` and must confirm the result still matches what is
committed. A byte-exact ``git diff`` cannot do this reliably: GitHub's runner
fleet is hardware-heterogeneous, so the same pinned software stack computes a
handful of plotted path coordinates ~1 ULP apart depending on which CPU
microarchitecture the run lands on (a different SIMD kernel in the numpy/BLAS
stack). That sub-pixel drift is numerically and visually irrelevant, yet a
byte diff flags the figure as stale, which made the job intermittently fail.

This script compares the freshly regenerated working-tree figures against the
committed versions (``git HEAD``) within a tolerance instead:

* **SVG** -- the non-numeric structure (elements, text, colours, ordering)
  must be identical, and every numeric token must agree within an absolute or
  relative tolerance. A moved element, changed label or new path fails; a
  last-bit coordinate wobble passes.
* **Raster (WebP/PNG)** -- identical dimensions, and *both* (a) at most
  ``RASTER_MAX_SIG_PIXELS`` pixels whose per-channel difference exceeds
  ``RASTER_LEVEL_TOL`` and (b) a per-pixel root-mean-square difference below
  ``RASTER_RMS_TOL``. The pixel count
  catches a *localised* change (a moved line, a relabelled axis) that a global
  RMS would dilute in a large image; the RMS catches a *broad* change (a
  recoloured background) that few-but-everywhere pixels would slip past the
  count. Cross-CPU sub-ULP coordinate drift changes neither meaningfully.
* **Anything else** -- exact byte compare.

Added or removed files always fail: a new figure must be committed, and a
figure that is no longer generated must be removed from the tree.

The check is intentionally strict about *structure* and lenient only about the
*last digits of numbers*, so it still catches every real figure change while
being immune to cross-CPU floating-point non-determinism.
