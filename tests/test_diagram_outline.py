"""The glyph-outlining engine of the diagram plates, one test per risk.

The plates are committed byte for byte, so the engine's measurement and
emission are part of the repository's contract: pen advances that keep
boundary spaces, clusters that never split a combining mark from its
base, a deterministic fallback chain with a hard error past its end, and
an atlas whose ids are content-derived. The canary pins the private
matplotlib layout helper the shaping rides on, so a wheel bump fails
here instead of in the artwork.
