title: "Resilient layers"
description: "The mechanical property a floating floor is designed around: the dynamic stiffness per unit area of a resilient layer, the EN 29052-1 load-plate resonance that measures it, the enclosed-gas term, and the natural frequency it sets under a screed."
---

A floating floor is a mass-spring system: the screed is the mass, the resilient
layer is the spring, and the impact improvement the pair buys begins above the
resonance they set. That resonance is fixed by the mass per unit area m' of the
slab, in kg/m², and by the **dynamic stiffness per unit area** s' of the layer,
in MN/m³ — the dynamic force per unit area divided by the change in thickness it
produces. A 120 kg/m² screed on a 10 MN/m³ layer resonates near 46 Hz; halving
the stiffness moves that down by a factor of the square root of two, and
everything the floor achieves in the rated bands follows from where the
resonance sits. This is why s' is the one number a resilient-layer datasheet
must carry, and why it is a *dynamic* stiffness: a static compression test
describes neither the audio frequency range nor the working preload.

[Dynamic stiffness of resilient materials (EN 29052-1)](/phonometry/materials/resilient/dynamic-stiffness/)
is the measurement that produces it. A 200 mm × 200 mm specimen carries an 8 kg
load plate — 200 kg/m² in total, which reproduces the roughly 2 kPa static
preload of a real floating floor — and a vertical exciter with an accelerometer
gives the fundamental resonance of the plate-on-specimen system, from which the
apparent stiffness follows directly. For an air-permeable material the pore air
is a second spring in parallel with the frame, and the standard adds it back
through an enclosed-gas term that depends on the loaded thickness: the installed
stiffness therefore depends on how the layer will be sealed and on its lateral
airflow resistivity, which is what the clause 8.2 regimes decide. The guide
chains all of it and renders the clause 9 test-report fiche.

Two inputs come from outside this subsection. The resonant frequency has to be
extrapolated to zero force amplitude by the clause 7 procedure, and the airflow
resistivity is measured by ISO 9053 in
[Airflow Resistance](/phonometry/materials/absorbers/airflow-resistance/) — note
that ISO 9053 reports it in Pa·s/m² while this page's argument is in kPa·s/m².
What the design side does with s' is
[Predicting resilient-layer performance](/phonometry/buildings/design/resilient-layers/),
which turns it into the floating-floor improvement and the ISO 12354-1 Annex D
lining rating.

- [Dynamic stiffness of resilient materials (EN 29052-1)](/phonometry/materials/resilient/dynamic-stiffness/):
  the load-plate resonance method, the apparent stiffness it yields, the
  enclosed-gas term for air-permeable layers, the airflow-resistivity regimes
  of clause 8.2 and the clause 9 test-report fiche.

Pages elsewhere on the site that this section leans on:

- [Airflow Resistance](/phonometry/materials/absorbers/airflow-resistance/): the
  ISO 9053 measurement of the lateral resistivity the regime rule needs.
- [Predicting resilient-layer performance](/phonometry/buildings/design/resilient-layers/):
  the consumer, where s' becomes a floating-floor improvement.

## What this section does not cover

The measurement starts one step after the signal. Clause 7's extraction of the
resonant frequency from the raw excitation-response record — by sinusoidal,
white-noise or pulse excitation — and its extrapolation to zero force amplitude
are **not implemented**: pass a resonant frequency that has already been
extrapolated. The lateral airflow resistivity is an input, not a measurement.
Clause 6's specimen-selection requirement of at least three 200 mm × 200 mm
specimens is not enforced, so nothing here objects if you characterise a
material from one. And the layer's other properties — creep under long-term
load, compressive strength, thermal performance — are outside the standard and
outside the library.
