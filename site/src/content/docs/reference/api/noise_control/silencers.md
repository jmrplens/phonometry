Reactive silencers by the four-pole (transmission-matrix) method.

A reactive silencer controls noise by *reflecting* it back to the source with
impedance discontinuities -- sudden area changes and side branches -- rather
than by dissipating it in absorptive material. The one-dimensional plane-wave
theory represents each acoustic element by a 2x2 **transfer (four-pole)
matrix** relating the sound pressure `p` and volume velocity `S u` at its
two ends, and a compound silencer is the ordered matrix product of its
elements (Bies, Hansen & Howard, *Engineering Noise Control* 5th ed., §8.8-8.9;
Munjal, *Acoustics of Ducts and Mufflers*).

**Transfer matrix** (Bies Eq. (8.133)), state vector `[p, S u]` with the
characteristic acoustic impedance `Z = rho c / S`. The plane-wave element for
a straight duct of length `L` and area `S` is (Bies Eq. (8.143), no flow)

    [[ cos(kL),              j (rho c / S) sin(kL) ],
     [ j (S / rho c) sin(kL), cos(kL)              ]],    k = omega / c,

and a **side branch** of acoustic impedance `Z_b` is the shunt element
(Bies Eq. (8.144))

    [[ 1,       0 ],
     [ 1 / Z_b, 1 ]].

**Transmission loss** from the compound matrix `T` (Munjal, *Acoustics of
Ducts and Mufflers* 2nd ed., Eq. (3.27), no flow; reduces to Bies Eq. (8.148)
for equal inlet/outlet areas):

    TL = 10 log10[ (Zn / Z1) (1/4) | T11 + T12 / Zn + Z1 T21 + (Z1 / Zn) T22 |^2 ]

with `Z1 = rho c / S_in` and `Zn = rho c / S_out`. A zero-length element
between unequal areas then reproduces the classic sudden-expansion result
`TL = 10 log10[(1 + m)^2 / (4 m)]` with `m = S_out / S_in`, and the TL is
the same from either side, as reciprocity of a passive two-port requires.
Bies Eq. (8.141) prints this formula with impedance ratios on `T11` and
`T22` (`Z_A1/Z_An` and `Z_An/Z_A1`) instead of the overall `Zn/Z1`
prefactor; as printed it fails the sudden-expansion limit (see
`docs/ERRATA.md`). `TL` is the intrinsic attenuation for an anechoic
termination. The **insertion loss** for a source of internal impedance
`Z_s` radiating into a termination impedance `Z_r` is the extra
attenuation of inserting the silencer in place of a direct connection,

    IL = 20 log10 | (T11 Z_r + T12 + Z_s Z_r T21 + Z_s T22) / (Z_s + Z_r) |,

which is `0` when the silencer reduces to a through connection (`T = I`)
and, for equal inlet/outlet areas, equals the transmission loss for the
anechoic reference `Z_s = Z_r = rho c / S` (with unequal areas the direct
connection contains the same area jump, so its mismatch loss cancels from
the insertion loss but not from the transmission loss).

**Simple expansion chamber.** A chamber of area `S_exp` and length `L`
between pipes of area `S_duct` has the closed-form transmission loss (Bies
Eq. (8.111)) with area ratio `m = S_exp / S_duct`

    TL = 10 log10[ 1 + (1/4) (m - 1/m)^2 sin^2(kL) ],

peaking at `10 log10[1 + (1/4)(m - 1/m)^2]` when `kL = pi/2, 3pi/2, ...` and
dropping to `0` at `kL = n pi` (no dissipation). The four-pole product
reproduces this exactly, and the machinery extends to side-branch (Helmholtz,
quarter-wave) and extended-tube resonators that the closed form cannot cover.

expansion_chamber(
    frequencies: ArrayLike,

```

Extended-inlet/outlet expansion chamber (Bies §8.9.7).

The inlet and outlet pipes extend a distance into the chamber, forming
annular quarter-wave side branches (of area `S_exp - S_duct` and lengths
equal to the extensions, Bies Eq. (8.156)) at the two junctions. Tuning the
extensions (classically `L/4` and `L/2`) places quarter-wave peaks that
fill the `kL = n pi` troughs of the plain expansion chamber. With both
extensions `0` the result reduces exactly to [`expansion_chamber`](/phonometry/reference/api/noise_control/silencers/#expansion_chamber).
