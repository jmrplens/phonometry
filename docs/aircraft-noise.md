# Aircraft noise: Effective Perceived Noise Level (ICAO Annex 16 / IEC 61265)

The **Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL)** is the noise-certification metric
for transport-category aircraft. It condenses a half-second one-third-octave
spectral time history of a flyover into a single number, in EPNdB, through five
steps of **ICAO Annex 16, Vol. I, Appendix 2**. This page covers the four
primitives that build the metric and the IEC 61265 measurement-system verifier.
Each quantity is validated against the worked examples of the ICAO Doc 9501
Environmental Technical Manual (ETM) Vol. I.

## 1. Perceived noisiness and PNL

Each of the 24 one-third-octave-band levels (50 Hz–10 kHz) is converted to a
perceived **noisiness** in noys by the analytic piecewise law of Table A2-3,
then combined into the total noisiness and the perceived noise level:

$$
N = 0.85\,n_{\max} + 0.15\sum_i n_i, \qquad
\mathrm{PNL} = 40 + \frac{10}{\lg 2}\,\lg N .
$$

```python
from phonometry import aircraft

noys = aircraft.perceived_noisiness(spl)      # per-band noys (spl = 24 band levels, dB)
pnl = aircraft.perceived_noise_level(spl)      # PNdB
```

## 2. Tone correction

Spectral irregularities (fan/turbine tones) are penalised by a **tone
correction** `C`, found with the slope ("encircling") method: slopes are
smoothed to a background spectrum `SPL''`, the tone excess `F = SPL − SPL''`
above 1.5 dB is mapped to a correction factor (frequency-split at 500 Hz /
5000 Hz, capped at 6⅔ dB), and the maximum over bands is taken.

```python
from phonometry import aircraft

c = aircraft.tone_correction(spl)              # dB; added to PNL to give PNLT
```

The implementation reproduces the ICAO Doc 9501 ETM Vol. I **Table 3-7**
turbofan example exactly, including its `SPL''` background column and the
resulting `C = 2.0 dB` at 2500 Hz.

## 3. EPNL

Over the flyover, the tone-corrected level is `PNLT = PNL + C`; its maximum is
`PNLTM`. The metric integrates `PNLT` over the **10 dB-down** window (the
records nearest to `PNLTM − 10` on each side) and normalises to 10 s:

$$
\mathrm{EPNL} = 10\lg\!\Big(\sum_{k=k_F}^{k_L} 10^{\mathrm{PNLT}(k)/10}\,\Delta t(k)\Big)
- 10\lg T_0, \qquad T_0 = 10\ \mathrm{s},
$$

so `EPNL = PNLTM + D` with the duration correction `D`.

```python
import numpy as np
from phonometry import aircraft

# spectra: a (K, 24) array of one-third-octave band levels sampled every dt s
res = aircraft.effective_perceived_noise_level(spectra, dt=0.5)
print(res.epnl, res.pnltm, res.duration_correction, res.band_limits)
res.plot()   # PNL/PNLT time history (needs matplotlib)
```

`effective_perceived_noise_level` returns an `EPNLResult` bundling the per-record
`pnl`, `tone_correction`, `pnlt`, the peak `pnltm`, the `duration_correction`,
the `epnl` and the 10 dB-down `band_limits`. The reference-condition
integrated-method example of ETM Vol. I **Table 4-4** (a 31-record `PNLT`
history with non-uniform durations) is reproduced as `EPNL = 92.6 EPNdB`.
`epnl_from_pnlt` exposes the duration/limit machinery directly from a `PNLT`
series.

aircraft.effective_perceived_noise_level(spectra, dt).plot()
```

## 4. Measurement-system verification (IEC 61265)

`verify_aircraft_noise_system` checks a supplied set of measured performance
values against the IEC 61265:1995 tolerances for aircraft-noise measurement
systems: the microphone directional-response limits (Table 1, with the
"intermediate angle uses the greater angle's limit" rule) and the scalar
frequency-response, linearity and resolution limits. The one-third-octave
filtering itself is covered by the library's IEC 61260 class-2 filter
verification (`verify_filter_class`).

```python
from phonometry import metrology

report = metrology.verify_aircraft_noise_system(
    directional={4000.0: {30: 0.4, 60: 0.9, 90: 1.9, 120: 2.4, 150: 2.4}},
    frequency_response={1000.0: 1.2},
)
print(report["passed"], report["checks"])
```

## 5. Atmospheric absorption (SAE ARP 5534)

Correcting a measured flyover spectrum to reference atmospheric conditions
needs the one-third-octave-band attenuation over the path. The pure-tone
coefficient is the ISO 9613-1 one (identical, per ARP 5534 §3.1) already
provided by `air_attenuation`; `sae_band_attenuation` adds the **SAE Method**
(ARP 5534 §3.2.2), a regression that maps the pure-tone mid-band path-length
attenuation `δ_t = α·s` to the band attenuation `δ_B` and stays consistent with
the ISO/ANSI Exact Method well beyond the 50 dB limit of the older Approximate
Method.

print(att.band_attenuation)   # δ_B per band, dB
att.plot()                    # band vs pure-tone mid-band (needs matplotlib)
```

`sae_band_attenuation` returns an `AircraftBandAttenuation` with `band_attenuation`
(`δ_B`), `midband_attenuation` (`δ_t = α·s`) and the pure-tone `coefficient`
(`α`, dB/m). The SAE Method is valid roughly 6–32 °C and 20–95 % RH (the 14 CFR
Part 36 test window), over path lengths to 7620 m, and is reciprocal
(source↔receiver).

## 6. Airport noise: the NPD engine (ECAC Doc 29)

The ECAC Doc 29 airport-noise method describes an aircraft with **noise-power-
distance (NPD)** tables give the event level (`LAmax` or `SEL`) of steady straight
flight versus engine power and slant distance. `npd_level` reads an event level
for an arbitrary power and distance, interpolating **linearly in power**
(Eq. 4-3) and **log-linearly in distance** (Eq. 4-4), extrapolating from the
terminal segments beyond the tabulated envelope.

## 7. Airport noise contours (single event)

The full ECAC Doc 29 single-event calculation places a flight path's noise at a
receiver by breaking the path into segments and, for each, correcting the NPD
baseline level (§4.3-4.5):

- **`impedance_adjustment(T, p)`**: corrects the NPD data from their reference
  air impedance (409.81 N·s/m³) to the aerodrome's temperature and pressure
  (Eq. 4-6/4-7; +0.074 dB under the standard atmosphere).
- **`lateral_attenuation(β, ℓ)`**: excess lateral attenuation over soft ground
  (Eq. 4-18/4-19, AIR-5662).
- **`engine_installation_correction(φ, mounting)`**: lateral-directivity term
  for wing/fuselage/propeller installations (Eq. 4-15/4-16).
- **`duration_correction(Vref, Vseg)`**: the speed/duration adjustment for
  exposure levels (Eq. 4-14).
- **`noise_fraction(q, λ, dλ)`**: the finite-segment energy fraction (Eq. 4-20).
- **`start_of_roll_directivity(ψ, dSOR, engine)`**: the rearward jet/turboprop
  directivity behind takeoff ground-roll segments (Eq. 4-22/4-24/4-25). Pass a
  boolean `ground_roll` mask to `event_level`/`noise_contour` to flag the takeoff
  ground-roll segments; behind them the reduced (q = 0) noise fraction and `ΔSOR`
  are applied (Eq. 4-9).

The mechanism behind these ground corrections is two-path interference: the
direct wave and its ground reflection. Below, a 400 Hz source 1.5 m above a
rigid plane forms the lobe pattern, with the image source ghosted below the
ground and a receiver sitting in an interference dip.

`ΔSOR` is what makes the departure footprint bulge rearward behind the runway:
jet-exhaust noise radiates a lobed pattern in the rear arc, strongest at an
azimuth `ψ ≈ 120°` from the nose and falling away both abeam (`ψ = 90°`) and
directly behind (`ψ = 180°`).

`event_level` assembles these (Eq. 4-8/4-9) and sums the segments into the exposure
level `SEL` (Eq. 4-11) or the maximum level `LAmax` (Eq. 4-10); `noise_contour`
evaluates `event_level` over a ground grid to produce a noise contour. Mark the
takeoff ground-roll segments with the boolean `ground_roll` mask.

Validated against the **ECAC Doc 29 5th ed. Vol 3 Part 1 reference workbook**:
the segment geometry (β, φ), lateral attenuation, engine installation, noise
fraction and the start-of-roll directivity `ΔSOR` (turbofan and turboprop, all
124 ground-roll reference rows to < 0.01 dB) reproduce the reference values, and
the segment energy sum matches the reference `SEL`.

The model also covers the landing rollout (`landing_roll` mask: reduced noise
fraction Eq. 4-21b, nearest-end geometry, no directivity term), per-segment
bank angle (`bank`, §4.5.2 sign convention), the §4.5.5 nearest-end lateral
geometry behind takeoff roll, the Eq. 4-13b average runway-segment speed and
the recommended 30 m floor on NPD lookups. Seven branch-covering receptor
events of the reference workbook are reproduced end-to-end in the test suite.

ECAC Doc 29, 4th ed., Vol 2 (2016): the NPD event-level interpolation (§4.2) and
the single-event segment calculation (duration, §4.5.1; engine installation,
§4.5.3; lateral attenuation, §4.5.4, AIR-5662; the finite-segment noise
fraction, §4.5.6; the start-of-roll directivity, §4.5.7; and segment summation,
§4.3) through to ground-grid noise contours, with the impedance adjustment
(§4.2.1). The single-event chain is validated against the ECAC Doc 29 5th ed.
Vol 3 Part 1 reference workbook.
