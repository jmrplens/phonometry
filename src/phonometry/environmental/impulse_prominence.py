Prominence of impulsive sounds and the LAeq adjustment (NT ACOU 112:2002).

Noise with prominent impulses is more annoying than a steady sound of the same
equivalent level, so the Nordtest method adds an adjustment ``KI`` to the
measured ``LAeq``. The audibility of an impulse is captured by the **predicted
prominence** ``P``, a logarithmic measure of the onset rate and the level
difference of the impulse (clause 7):

``P = 3*lg(onset_rate) + 2*lg(level_difference)``   (Formula 1)

From the impulse with the highest prominence over a 30-minute period, a
graduated adjustment follows (clause 8):

``KI = 1.8*(P - 5)`` dB for ``P > 5``, else ``0``   (Formula 2)

and the rating level over a reference time interval combines the adjusted
sub-interval levels (clause 8, Note 1). An impulse qualifies when its onset
rate exceeds 10 dB/s (clauses 4.5-4.7); non-qualifying level rises receive
no adjustment (clause 8 applies only "for sounds with onset rates larger
than 10 dB/s").
