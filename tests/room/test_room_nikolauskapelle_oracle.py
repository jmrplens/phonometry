"""Room acoustic parameters of a real measured RIR against published values.

Source: "Room acoustic measurement and simulation data of the St. Nicholas
Chapel, Aachen Cathedral", M. Zerwas and S. Kayku (FH Aachen), Zenodo,
DOI 10.5281/zenodo.20428705, CC BY 4.0 (see ``tests/data/audio/README.md``):
a coupled Gothic chapel, V of about 3050 m3, measured per ISO 3382-1 with
a dodecahedral source and an exponential sweep. The committed npz holds
the omnidirectional (W) channel of the impulse response ``S1-Do_R1``
(source 1, receiver 1, 2.56 m apart); the expected values below are
transcribed from the deposit's own results workbook
(``Nikolauskapelle_Source1_Results_20260205.xlsx``, sheet "Parameters",
row "S1-Do_R1"), one value per one-third-octave band from 100 Hz to 5 kHz.

Tolerances are the just noticeable differences of ISO 3382-1:2009,
Table A.1 -- the standard's own yardstick for when two values of a
parameter count as the same: 5 % for the decay times (EDT, T20, T30),
1 dB for the clarities (C80, C50), 0.05 for D50 and 10 ms for Ts. The
authors' software and this library differ in filterbank realization,
onset detection and truncation handling, so agreeing within one JND on a
4.5 s decay is as strong an equivalence as the parameter definition
supports.

Two edge cases sit outside one JND and are asserted at the looser bound
below instead: the 100 Hz early-energy ratios (C80 -1.1 dB, C50 -2.1 dB,
D50 -0.12, and at 250 Hz Ts +13 ms), where a one-third-octave filter's
group delay is comparable to the early/late split so the ratio is
dominated by the onset convention; and EDT at 5 kHz (+7.7 %), where the
air-absorption-shortened decay leaves the 0 to -10 dB fit only ~0.1 s of
data. Every parameter in every band is still pinned within three JNDs;
nothing is left unasserted.
