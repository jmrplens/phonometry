# Errata found in published standards and guidance documents

During the clean-room implementation of this library, every formula, constant
and worked example is re-derived and recomputed independently from the source
documents. That process occasionally surfaces defects in the sources
themselves: misprints, worked examples that contradict their own normative
text, and ambiguous wording. This file records each confirmed case with the
evidence, what the library does about it, and whether it has been reported to
the issuing body.

Entries describe the specific printed editions cited. A defect listed here is
not a defect of the method; in every case the intended reading could be
established from the document itself or from physics, and the library
implements that reading with a regression test pinning it.

## ISO 717-2:2020 — Annex C, example C.1 (CI of the bare floor)

- **Location:** Annex C, Table C.1 and the accompanying CI computation.
- **The print:** the 2020 reprint states CI = −10 for the bare-floor example.
- **The problem:** its own normative clause A.2.1 defines CI from the energy
  sum over 100 Hz to 2500 Hz (the first fifteen one-third-octave bands). The
  2020 reprint's value only reproduces if the 3150 Hz band is included in the
  sum (83,5238 dB, rounded 84), contradicting A.2.1. The correct sum over
  100 to 2500 Hz is 83,2613 dB, rounded 83, giving CI = −11.
- **Evidence:** independent recomputation of both sums from the printed
  per-band levels; the 2013 edition of the same example prints CI = −11.
- **Library behaviour:** implements A.2.1 as written and pins CI = −11 with
  the 2013 print as the oracle ([`tests/reference_data.py`](../tests/reference_data.py),
  conformance check
  "ISO 717-2 Annex C, Table C.1").
- **Status:** unreported.

## ISO 717-2:2020 — Annex C, example C.2 (covered floor, 800 Hz value)

- **Location:** Annex C, Table C.2.
- **The print:** the 800 Hz value of the reference floor with covering is
  printed as 71,0 dB.
- **The problem:** the normative Table 4 reference floor minus the printed
  improvement at 800 Hz gives 71,5 dB; the 71,0 dB misprint propagates into
  the example's CI chain (yielding −8 where the normative-table chain gives
  −9).
- **Evidence:** independent recomputation from Table 4 and the printed
  improvement spectrum.
- **Library behaviour:** derives the covered floor from the normative Table 4
  values; the conformance check notes the provenance explicitly.
- **Status:** unreported.

## ISO 2631-5:2018 — Annex C, NOTE 5 (female worked example)

- **Location:** Annex C, NOTE 5 (64 kg female, mz = 0,025 MPa/(m/s²)).
- **The print:** R = 0,97.
- **The problem:** exact recomputation of Formula (C.3) with the note's own
  inputs (mz = 0,025, age coefficient 0,039, b = 20, n = 20, N = 120) gives
  R = 0,9621, which rounds to 0,96. The same code reproduces the male example
  exactly (R = 1,2200 = printed 1,22), and the note's Sd = 1,40 MPa matches
  the exact 1,3992, so the discrepancy is confined to the last digit of the
  printed female R.
- **Evidence:** hand recomputation of the C.3 sum, term by term.
- **Library behaviour:** computes the exact value; the test anchor keeps the
  printed 0,97 with a tolerance that documents the recomputed 0,9621.
- **Status:** unreported.

## EN 12354-1:2000 — Annex E.5 (K24 clamp misprint)

- **Location:** Annex E, clause E.5 (double-leaf lightweight element coupled
  to a homogeneous element).
- **The print:** the bound on the K24 junction term is printed as
  "0 ≤ K24 ≤ −4 dB", an empty interval.
- **The problem:** the interval is impossible as printed; the accompanying
  figure and the physics (the term is a reduction bounded below) indicate
  −4 dB ≤ K24 ≤ 0 dB.
- **Evidence:** page render of the printed clause; corroboration against the
  figure's curve family.
- **Library behaviour:** implements the clamp as −4 ≤ K24 ≤ 0 with a misprint
  note in the docstring.
- **Status:** unreported.

## EN 12354-2:2000 — Formula (3) vs Annex E.3 (standardized impact level)

- **Location:** Formula (3) and worked example E.3.
- **The print:** Formula (3) defines L'nT = L'n − 10 lg(0,16·V/(A0·T0)), which
  reduces exactly to L'n − 10 lg(0,032·V), i.e. a reference volume of
  31,25 m³. Annex E.3 states "from equation (3): L'nT,w = L'n,w − 10 lg(V/30)".
- **The problem:** the annex's V/30 is a rounding of the formula's own
  constant; the two differ by a constant 0,177 dB.
- **Evidence:** direct algebra; both variants recomputed for the E.3 case
  (42,959 vs 42,782 dB, both rounding to 43 in that example).
- **Library behaviour:** implements the exact 0,032·V form and documents the
  annex's rounding.
- **Status:** unreported.

## EN 12354-3:2000 — Annex F (worked example internal inconsistencies)

- **Location:** Annex F worked example.
- **The print:** (a) the printed D2m,nT row equals R' + 1,5 dB; (b) the
  printed high-frequency-band row is inconsistent with the example's own
  partial indices.
- **The problem:** Formula (13) with the example's own inputs (V = 50 m³,
  S = 11,3 m², T0 = 0,5 s) gives D2m,nT = R' + 1,69 dB, not +1,5 dB; and the
  high-band row cannot be reproduced from the example's stated partial
  results (the self-consistent values are 35,8/38,0 dB).
- **Evidence:** recomputation of Formula (13) and of the partial-index chain.
  The example's single-number result D2m,nT,w = 33 dB is insensitive to both
  and still reproduces.
- **Library behaviour:** implements Formula (13); the test data notes both
  inconsistencies next to the affected anchors.
- **Status:** unreported.

## ISO 12999-1:2020 — Table 4 (missing 500 Hz row)

- **Location:** Table 4 (in-situ uncertainties per band).
- **The print:** the 2020 edition's table omits the 500 Hz row that the 2014
  edition prints (situation B 1,2 dB / situation C 0,8 dB).
- **The problem:** likely an editorial omission; the surrounding rows are
  unchanged between editions and the text does not mention removing the band.
- **Evidence:** side-by-side comparison of the 2014 and 2020 prints.
- **Library behaviour:** follows the 2020 print as published, with the
  omission documented in the module.
- **Status:** unreported.

## ISO 12999-2:2020 — Clause 8 wording vs Tables 4 and 5

- **Location:** Clause 8 (expression of results) and Tables 4/5.
- **The print:** the clause wording instructs rounding the standard
  uncertainty u before forming the expanded uncertainty U = k·u.
- **The problem:** the document's own Tables 4 and 5 only reproduce when U is
  computed from the unrounded u and rounded last; the literal clause wording
  fails half of the printed table entries.
- **Evidence:** recomputation of all 25 table entries under both conventions
  (round-last: 25 of 25 match; round-first: 10 of 20 mismatch).
- **Library behaviour:** rounds last, matching the tables; the convention is
  documented and tested.
- **Status:** unreported.

## ISO 10052:2021 — Table 4 volume-range header

- **Location:** Table 4 (reverberation-index estimator), volume-range header.
- **The print:** the header reads "60 ≤ V < 150" while the body text says the
  method applies to rooms "up to 150 m³".
- **The problem:** the boundary V = 150 m³ is included by the text and
  excluded by the header.
- **Evidence:** direct comparison of header and clause text.
- **Library behaviour:** accepts V = 150 (follows the text), with the
  ambiguity noted.
- **Status:** unreported.

## ISO 17208-2:2019 — Clause 5 uncertainty band coverage

- **Location:** Clause 5 (representative expanded uncertainties).
- **The print:** 5 dB for the low-frequency bands (10 Hz to 100 Hz), 3 dB for
  the mid-frequency bands (125 Hz to 16 000 Hz), 4 dB for the high-frequency
  bands (above 20 000 Hz).
- **The problem:** the band list leaves the 20 kHz one-third-octave band
  unassigned (nothing covers 16 kHz to 20 kHz inclusive).
- **Evidence:** the clause's own enumeration.
- **Library behaviour:** applies the conservative 4 dB high-band value from
  just above 16 kHz, with the gap documented.
- **Status:** unreported.

## NORAH2 rotorcraft guidance SC03.D1.5d (EASA.2020.FC.06) — Eq. (27)

- **Location:** section A.4.2, Eq. (27) (atmospheric absorption coefficient).
- **The print:** the coefficient 6,6928·10⁻⁶ is paired with the relaxation
  frequency frO = 630,7 Hz.
- **The problem:** evaluated as printed, the equation yields nonsense
  (14,3 dB/km at 500 Hz against the guidance's own Table 4 value of 3,1).
  The physically correct pairing (6,6928·10⁻⁶ with the oxygen relaxation
  frequency, about 75 692 Hz at the reference conditions, and 1,3415·10⁻⁶
  with 630,7 Hz) reproduces Table 4 and the ISO 9613-1 pure-tone coefficient
  to 0,02 dB/km.
- **Evidence:** numeric evaluation of both pairings against Table 4.
- **Library behaviour:** implements the correct pairing; the module docstring
  carries a defensive note so the misprint is not transcribed as a "fix".
- **Status:** unreported.

## RANDI 3.1 Physics Description (NRL, Breeding et al.) — Table 2

- **Location:** Table 2 (representative ship source levels).
- **The print:** two cells deviate from the report's own Eqs. (2) to (5)
  evaluated with the Table 1 average lengths and speeds: the Merchant value
  at 25 Hz (about 3 dB high) and the Tanker value at 300 Hz (about 1 dB low).
  The Fishing Vessel row is not reproducible from the Table 1 averages at
  all (a constant offset of about 3,8 dB suggests different assumed inputs).
- **The problem:** the report does not state the exact inputs used for
  Table 2, and two cells contradict its own equations while every Large
  Tanker and Super Tanker cell agrees to 0,06 dB.
- **Evidence:** recomputation of all 25 cells from Eqs. (2) to (5).
- **Library behaviour:** the regression test pins the reproducible rows and
  excludes the contradicting cells with the rationale in the test.
- **Status:** unreported (technical report rather than a standard).

## Related source properties that are not errata

Recorded here to prevent future "fixes" that would break agreement with the
published sources:

- **Francois-Garrison pure-water term:** the two published A3 cubics do not
  meet exactly at the 20 °C switch (a step of 1·10⁻⁷·f² dB/km, 0,1 dB/km at
  1 MHz). Inherent in the published coefficients.
- **Ainslie-McColm simplification:** the paper's "within 10 % of
  Francois-Garrison" claim is marginally exceeded at the extreme corners of
  its stated domain (10,4 % at −6 °C / 1 MHz; 12,3 % at 7 km depth). A
  property of the published fit; both transcriptions verified digit-for-digit.
- **ICAO Annex 16 EPNL constant:** the Annex's rounded constant 13 for
  uniform 0,5 s records differs from the exact −10·lg(T0) form by 0,0103 dB;
  the library uses the exact form, which the ETM's integrated reference
  reproduces to five decimals.
