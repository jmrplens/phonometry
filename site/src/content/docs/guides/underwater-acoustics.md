description: "ISO 18405 reference levels (SPL, SEL, peak) re 1 µPa, the ISO 17208 ship radiated noise level and equivalent monopole source level via the Lloyd's-mirror correction, and the ISO 18406 single-strike, peak and cumulative pile-driving sound exposure."

Underwater sound is referenced to **1 µPa** (not the 20 µPa of airborne
acoustics), and its exposure to **1 µPa²·s**. This page covers the ISO 18405
reference levels realised as the shared primitives, the ISO 17208 ship
**radiated noise level** and equivalent **monopole source level**, and the
ISO 18406 percussive **pile-driving** single-strike, peak and cumulative sound
exposure. Every quantity is an exact closed form, verified analytically.

## 1. Reference levels (ISO 18405)

Three primitives, referred to 1 µPa, are computed from a captured pressure
signal (in Pa):

$$
\mathrm{SPL} = 10\lg\frac{\langle p^2\rangle}{p_0^2}, \qquad
\mathrm{SEL} = 10\lg\frac{\int p^2\,dt}{E_0}, \qquad
L_{p,\mathrm{pk}} = 20\lg\frac{\max|p|}{p_0},
$$

with `p₀ = 1 µPa` and `E₀ = 1 µPa²·s`. The sound pressure level is the
mean-square level (ISO 18406 Formula 7); the sound exposure level integrates the
squared pressure over the record (Formulae 3–4); the peak level is the
zero-to-peak value.

```python
import phonometry as ph

spl = ph.sound_pressure_level(pressure)        # dB re 1 µPa
sel = ph.sound_exposure_level(pressure, fs)     # dB re 1 µPa²·s
pk = ph.peak_sound_pressure_level(pressure)     # dB re 1 µPa
```

To re-reference a level between the underwater (1 µPa) and airborne (20 µPa)
conventions — a `20·lg(20) ≈ 26.02` dB shift, **not** an energy/intensity
equivalence — use `underwater_to_in_air_spl` / `in_air_to_underwater_spl`. For
background-noise subtraction, reuse the ISO 3744 `background_noise_correction`
(`K1`) helper.

## 2. Ship radiated noise and source level (ISO 17208-1/-2)

A surface ship measured in deep water is described first by its **radiated noise
level** and then by an **equivalent monopole source level**:

$$
L_{\mathrm{RN}} = 20\lg\frac{p_{\mathrm{rms}}}{p_0} + 20\lg\frac{r}{r_0}
\ \ \mathrm{dB\ re\ 1\ \mu Pa\!\cdot\! m}, \qquad
L_s = L_{\mathrm{RN}} + \Delta L,
$$

where the Lloyd's-mirror surface correction (ISO 17208-2 Formula 3) for a
nominal source depth `d_s = 0.7·D` (D = mean draught) and `u = k·d_s`,
`k = 2πf/c`, is

$$
\Delta L = -10\lg\frac{2u^4 + 14u^2}{14 + 2u^2 + u^4}\ \mathrm{dB}.
$$

`ΔL` diverges at low `u` (grazing / low frequency) and tends to `−10·lg(2) =
−3.01` dB as `u → ∞`. The reported source level is an *equivalent monopole
broadside* value and must be quoted with its source depth.

```python
import phonometry as ph

lrn = ph.radiated_noise_level(2e-6, 100.0)   # p_rms = 2 µPa, r = 100 m
res = ph.monopole_source_level(lrn, 200.0, draught=6.0)
print(res.source_level, res.surface_correction, res.source_depth)
res.plot()   # RNL, Ls and ΔL vs frequency (needs matplotlib)
```

`hydrophone_depths` gives the three ISO 17208-1 measurement depths from the
15°/30°/45° depression angles, and `source_level_uncertainty` the tabulated
expanded uncertainty (5 dB ≤100 Hz, 3 dB 125 Hz–16 kHz, 4 dB >16 kHz).

res = ph.monopole_source_level(rnl, freqs, draught=6.0)

## 3. Pile-driving sound (ISO 18406)

Percussive pile driving radiates one impulsive pulse per hammer strike. Each
strike has a **single-strike sound exposure level** `SEL_ss`; over a driving
sequence the exposures add to a **cumulative sound exposure level**:

$$
\mathrm{SEL_{cum}} = 10\lg\sum_{n} 10^{\mathrm{SEL}_n/10},
\qquad\text{and for } N \text{ identical strikes } = \mathrm{SEL_{ss}} + 10\lg N.
$$

```python
import phonometry as ph

sel_ss = ph.single_strike_sel(strike_pressure, fs)   # dB re 1 µPa²·s
sel_cum = ph.cumulative_sel_identical(sel_ss, 2000)   # 2000 strikes
res = ph.pile_strike_metrics(strike_pressure, fs)
print(res.single_strike_sel, res.peak_spl, res.pulse_duration)
res.plot()   # waveform + cumulative energy (needs matplotlib)
```

`pile_strike_metrics` bundles the single-strike SEL, the peak sound pressure
level, the SPL/Leq and the 90 %-energy pulse duration for one recorded strike;
`cumulative_sel` sums a sequence of differing per-strike SELs.

pressure = 8000.0 * envelope * np.sin(2 * np.pi * 180.0 * t)
res = ph.pile_strike_metrics(pressure, fs)
res.plot()

from percussive pile driving*: the single-strike (Formulae 3–4), peak and
