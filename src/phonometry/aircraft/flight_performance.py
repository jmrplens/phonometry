"""ECAC Doc 29 flight performance: procedural steps into a flight profile.

A published departure or arrival procedure is not a trajectory. It is a list of
*procedural steps* -- "climb at take-off thrust to 1500 ft", "accelerate to
210.6 kt at 984.3 ft/min", "descend on a 3 degree slope from 3000 ft at 180 kt"
-- and the aeroplane's own aerodynamic and engine coefficients. **ECAC Doc 29
5th ed., Volume 2, Appendix B** is the flight-mechanics model that turns the one
into the other: a *flight profile*, an ordered list of profile points carrying
distance along the ground track, height above the aerodrome, true airspeed and
corrected net thrust per engine. Corrected net thrust is what the NPD tables of
:mod:`phonometry.aircraft.airport_noise` are indexed on, so this model is what
stands between a published procedure and a noise contour.

* :class:`Aerodrome` -- the aerodrome and its weather, and the five atmosphere
  ratios of B3 that every equation below reads.
* :class:`PerformanceAircraft` with :class:`JetEngineCoefficients`,
  :class:`PropellerEngineCoefficients` and :class:`AerodynamicCoefficients` --
  the ANP coefficient tables the equations take their constants from.
* :class:`DepartureStep` and :class:`ApproachStep` -- one row each of a
  published procedure.
* :func:`departure_profile` and :func:`approach_profile` -- the model, returning
  a :class:`FlightProfile` of :class:`ProfilePoint`.

Units are the standard's and they are English throughout (B2): feet, knots,
pounds, pounds of thrust per engine, degrees Celsius in the thrust equations and
inches of mercury for pressure. Doc 29 keeps them "due to the history of the
overarching method [...] and the strong association that aviation has with
English units", and pins two conversion constants at deliberately imprecise
legacy values that must not be improved (footnotes 30 and 31, folios B-7/B-8).

Departures run forward from brake release and arrivals run **backwards** from
touchdown, which is why an arrival profile carries negative distances until the
aeroplane is on the runway (folio B-5).

_ACCELERATE_TOLERANCE_FT = 1.0
#: Iteration cap for the Accelerate step's fixed point.
#:
#: **Decision.** B6.1.3 gives a seed, a tolerance and a stop condition and no

#: hundred feet a single Accelerate step climbs -- and every reference case of

#: **Decision.** B6.1.3 does not define "terminated"; the 4th edition's footnote
#: 30 asks only that "the computer model should be programmed to inform the user
#: of the inconsistency". It raises here, naming the step and the

#: ``MaxContHiTemp`` and ``ReduceClimbHiTemp``, abbreviating the stem
#: differently in each case (``MaxTakeoff`` becomes ``MaxTkoff`` here and

    A step given both a rate of climb and an energy share factor keeps both, and
    the model prefers the energy share factor: "The ROC-values are altitude and
    atmosphere conditions dependent whereas ESF values adapt to changing airport
    elevations and atmosphere conditions" (B6.1.3, folio B-21), so of the two
    only the energy share factor still means what the manufacturer intended at
    another aerodrome. B6.1.3 leaves the choice to the model, putting it as
    advice: "it is preferable to use ESF values".

    The bank angle is an input rather than something derived, because Eq. B-14
    needs a turn radius and a turn radius needs the ground track, which this
    model does not build and Appendix B assumes it is given. Zero, the default,
