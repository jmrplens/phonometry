"""One-line canonical figures for the library's result objects.

Every public result dataclass exposes a thin ``plot(ax=None, **kwargs)``
method that delegates to a rendering function in this module, reproducing
the essence of its documentation figure in a single call::

    res = room_parameters(ir, fs)
    res.plot()

matplotlib is a *soft* dependency: importing :mod:`phonometry` and running
any computation works without it, and only calling ``.plot()`` (or the
functions here) requires it.  The import is therefore performed lazily and
raises a clear :class:`ImportError` with installation guidance when the
package is missing, mirroring :func:`phonometry.filters.design._showfilter`.

The functions are pure renderers: they never call ``plt.show``; when ``ax``
is ``None`` they create a fresh figure and axes, and they always *return*
the :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes` (or an array of axes for multi-panel
figures) so the plot can be composed into a larger layout.
