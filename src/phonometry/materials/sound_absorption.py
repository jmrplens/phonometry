Sound absorption in a reverberation room: BS EN ISO 354:2003.

The mean reverberation time of a reverberation room is measured empty and with
the test specimen installed. From those two reverberation times the equivalent
sound absorption area of the specimen is obtained via Sabine's equation, and for
a plane absorber the sound absorption coefficient follows by dividing by the
covered area (ISO 354:2003, Clauses 4 and 8.1).

Equivalent sound absorption area (ISO 354:2003, Eq. (5) empty room / Eq. (7) with
specimen; identical form)::

    A = 55,3 * V / (c * T) - 4 * V * m

with ``V`` the room volume (m3), ``c`` the speed of sound (m/s), ``T`` the
reverberation time (s) and ``m`` the power attenuation coefficient of air (1/m).
The speed of sound follows Eq. (6), valid for 15 degC to 30 degC::

    c = (331 + 0,6 * t/degC) m/s

The equivalent sound absorption area of the specimen and its absorption
coefficient (ISO 354:2003, Eq. (8) and Eq. (9))::

    AT = A2 - A1 = 55,3 * V * (1/(c2*T2) - 1/(c1*T1)) - 4 * V * (m2 - m1)
    alpha_s = AT / S

``alpha_s`` may exceed 1,0 (e.g. from diffraction/edge effects) and is not a
percentage (ISO 354:2003, Clause 3.7 NOTE 2); it is therefore never clamped.

The air attenuation coefficient ``m`` is defined by ISO 354 only through its
conversion from the ISO 9613-1 attenuation coefficient ``alpha`` (in dB/m)
(ISO 354:2003, 8.1.2.1)::

    m = alpha / (10 * lg e)

ISO 354 otherwise defers the calculation of ``alpha`` entirely to ISO 9613-1.
``m`` is therefore a user-supplied per-band parameter here (default 0, i.e. no air
correction); a caller holding ISO 9613-1 ``alpha`` values can convert them with
:func:`attenuation_from_alpha`.

    and ``A2`` follow from Sabine's equation (Eq. (5)/(7), delegated to
    :func:`absorption_area`) and the sound absorption coefficient
    ``alpha_s = (A2 - A1) / S`` from Eq. (8)/(9) (delegated to
    :func:`absorption_coefficient`); no formula is re-derived here.

    Both measurements are taken at the same air temperature and, for the air
    attenuation term, the same climatic conditions (ISO 354:2003, 6.3), so a
    single ``temperature`` and ``m`` apply to both. Use the lower-level
    :func:`absorption_coefficient` directly when the empty-room and
    with-specimen climates differ.

    :param frequencies: One-third-octave band centre frequencies, in Hz (the
        ISO 354 range is 100 Hz to 5000 Hz); a 1-D array matching ``t_empty``
        and ``t_specimen``.
    :param t_empty: Empty-room reverberation time ``T1``, per band, in seconds.
    :param t_specimen: With-specimen reverberation time ``T2``, per band, in
        seconds.
    :param volume: Reverberation-room volume ``V``, in cubic metres. A volume
        below the 150 m3 minimum of clause 6.1.1 emits an advisory
        :class:`AbsorptionWarning`.
    :param area: Area ``S`` covered by the test specimen, in square metres. An
        area outside the clause 6.2.1.1 range (10 m2 to 12 m2, upper limit
        scaled by ``(V/200)^(2/3)`` for ``V > 200 m3``) emits an advisory
        :class:`AbsorptionWarning`.
    :param temperature: Air temperature during the test, in degrees Celsius
        (default 20). Used for the speed of sound via Eq. (6) unless
        ``speed_of_sound`` is given; a temperature outside 15..30 degC emits an
        :class:`AbsorptionWarning`.
    :param humidity: Relative humidity during the test, in % (informational;
        recorded on the result but not used in the computation, which sees the
        climate only through ``m``). ``None`` leaves it unrecorded.
    :param speed_of_sound: Explicit speed of sound ``c``, in m/s; overrides
        ``temperature`` and Eq. (6) when supplied.
    :param m: Power attenuation coefficient of air ``m``, in 1/m (a scalar or a
        per-band array matching ``frequencies``; default 0, i.e. no air
        correction). Obtain it from an ISO 9613-1 attenuation coefficient with
        :func:`attenuation_from_alpha`.
    :return: A frozen :class:`SoundAbsorptionMeasurement`.
    :raises ValueError: If the frequency and reverberation-time arrays do not
        share one shape, or an input is non-physical (see
        :func:`absorption_coefficient`).
