"""ISO 16283 field sound-insulation test report (reportlab renderer).

Renders a :class:`~phonometry.building.insulation.AirborneInsulationResult`
(field airborne, ISO 16283-1:2014),
:class:`~phonometry.building.insulation.ImpactInsulationResult` (field
impact, ISO 16283-2:2020) or
:class:`~phonometry.building.insulation.FacadeInsulationResult` (field
facade, ISO 16283-3:2016) to the one-page field test report of each
standard's Clause 14, laid out like the recommended results form (ISO
16283-1 Annex B / ISO 16283-2 Annex C) and the accredited field reports
built on it:

* a title and the standard-basis line naming the field standard, the
  reported quantity and the ISO 717 rating part;
* an optional metadata header block (client, construction description,
  room volumes, partition area, climatic conditions ...), rendered only
  for the fields supplied on the :class:`ReportMetadata`;
* a two-panel body with the one-third-octave table on the left (the
  quantity to one decimal place, Clause 12) and the field curve versus the
  shifted ISO 717 reference on the right, drawn by the rating's own
  ``plot(ax=...)`` so the curve is native to the library;
* a boxed single-number field rating ``DnT,w (C; Ctr)`` / ``R'w (C; Ctr)``
  (ISO 717-1) or ``L'nT,w (CI)`` / ``L'n,w (CI)`` (ISO 717-2);
* the mandatory statement that the evaluation is based on field
  measurement results obtained by an engineering method (Clause 14 and the
  Annex forms print it verbatim);
* an optional verdict row when a requirement is supplied (airborne passes
  at or above it, impact at or below it);
* a footer identity/disclaimer block.

With ``verbose=True`` the table shows the measurement chain instead: the
energy-average source/receiving (or impact) levels and the receiving-room
reverberation time beside the reported quantity, the per-band content the
accredited field reports annex. The shared two-panel skeleton lives in
:mod:`._insulation_fiche` (used by both this field fiche and the laboratory
ISO 10140 fiche); this module only holds the ISO 16283 specifics. reportlab,
matplotlib and svglib are soft dependencies imported lazily by the shared
renderer (reportlab and svglib ship in the ``phonometry[report]`` extra,
matplotlib in ``phonometry[plot]``); each is guarded with an actionable
:class:`ImportError`.
