Regularized spectral inversion with frequency-dependent regularization.

Inverting a measured transfer function -- to equalize a measurement
loudspeaker, flatten a microphone response or post-process an acquired
impulse response -- cannot be a plain reciprocal ``1/H(f)``: wherever the
system radiates little energy (outside its passband, in deep notches) the
reciprocal explodes and the inverse filter amplifies nothing but noise.
Mueller & Massarani ("Transfer-Function Measurement with Sweeps", JAES
49(6), 2001, Secs. 3.1 and 4.5) therefore confine the inversion to the
transmission band: unity equalization in-band and a controlled, bounded
gain outside.

This module implements that behaviour with the frequency-dependent
Tikhonov regularization of Kirkeby & Nelson ("Digital Filter Design for
Inversion Problems in Sound Reproduction", JAES 47(7/8), 1999, Eq. (17)):

``H_inv(f) = conj(H(f)) / (|H(f)|**2 + epsilon(f))``,

where the regularization profile ``epsilon(f)`` is small inside the band
``[f1, f2]`` (the filter equalizes to unity within an analytic bound) and
large outside (the out-of-band gain is capped at ``1/(2*sqrt(epsilon))``,
the maximum of ``x/(x**2 + epsilon)``), with a smooth geometric cross-fade
over a transition zone bordering the band edges. A modeling delay makes
the mixed-phase inverse causal (Kirkeby & Nelson Sec. 2.4: the inverse of
a non-minimum-phase response is anticausal and must be delayed to be
realisable).

The closed forms above are the module's oracles: in-band the equalized
magnitude ``|H*H_inv|`` deviates from unity by exactly
``epsilon/( |H|**2 + epsilon )``, and out-of-band the filter gain never
exceeds the ``1/(2*sqrt(epsilon))`` bound.

    Design a regularized inverse filter for a measured impulse response.

    Computes the frequency-dependent Tikhonov inverse of Kirkeby & Nelson
    (JAES 47(7/8), 1999, Eq. (17)),

    ``H_inv(f) = conj(H(f)) / (|H(f)|**2 + epsilon(f))``,

    with ``epsilon(f)`` small across ``[f1, f2]`` and large outside, so the
    filter equalizes the response to unity in-band while the out-of-band
    gain stays bounded by ``1/(2*sqrt(epsilon_outside))`` -- the behaviour
    Mueller & Massarani (JAES 49(6), 2001, Secs. 3.1/4.5) obtain by
    band-passing the plain inverse. A modeling delay of ``delay`` samples
    (default half the FFT block) shifts the generally anticausal inverse of
    a mixed-phase response into a causal filter (Kirkeby & Nelson,
    Sec. 2.4).

    Both regularization levels are *relative* to the peak of ``|H|**2``
    (like the scalar ``regularization`` of :func:`phonometry.impulse_response`,
    which this generalises): in-band the equalized magnitude deviates from
    unity by at most ``regularization_inside * max|H|**2 / min|H|**2`` --
    the analytic residue ``epsilon/(|H|**2 + epsilon)`` -- and the achieved
    figure is reported as :attr:`InverseFilterResult.flatness_db`.

    Use the result's :meth:`InverseFilterResult.apply` to equalize
    recordings (or the excitation, for pre-emphasis) and read
    :attr:`InverseFilterResult.spectrum` to apply it spectrally.

    :param response: Measured impulse response (1-D array), or an
        :class:`phonometry.ImpulseResponseResult` from the sweep/MLS/Golay
        front ends (its sample rate is used when ``fs`` is omitted).
    :param fs: Sample rate in Hz. Optional when ``response`` carries one.
    :param f_range: ``(f1, f2)`` band, in Hz, over which the response is
        equalized to unity. Choose it inside the band actually excited and
        radiated; inverting unexcited regions only amplifies noise.
    :param regularization_inside: In-band regularization, as a fraction of
        the peak spectral power ``max|H|**2``. Default 1e-6.
    :param regularization_outside: Out-of-band regularization, same units.
        Default 1.0, which caps the out-of-band gain at 6 dB below the
        peak-normalised unity (``1/(2*sqrt(1)) = 0.5``).
    :param transition_octaves: Width of the geometric cross-fade between
        the two regularization levels, in octaves outside each band edge.
        Default 1/3.
    :param n_fft: FFT block length of the design (also the filter length).
        Default: the next power of two of ``2*len(response)``, so the
        circular design has room for the anticausal (delayed) part.
