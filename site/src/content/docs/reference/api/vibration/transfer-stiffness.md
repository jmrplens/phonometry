Dynamic transfer stiffness of resilient elements (ISO 10846-1/-2/-3).

The vibro-acoustic transfer property of a resilient element (a vibration
isolator, mount, bellows or hose) is its **dynamic transfer stiffness** — the
frequency-dependent ratio of the *blocking force* phasor `F2,b` on the output
(receiver) side to the displacement phasor `u1` on the input (source) side,
with the output blocked (ISO 10846-1, 3.7):

```text
k2,1 = F2,b / u1                                             [N/m]
```

For an isolator between two structures of large driving-point stiffness, the
force delivered to the receiver approximates this blocking force (ISO 10846-1,
Equation 7), so `k2,1` characterises the isolator's transmission. Results are
reported as a **level** re the reference stiffness `k0 = 1 N/m` (ISO 10846-2
and -3, 3.17):

```text
L_k = 10 lg(|k2,1|**2 / k0**2) = 20 lg(|k2,1| / k0)          [dB]
```

and, in the low-frequency range where inertial forces in the element are
negligible, the **loss factor** is the tangent of the phase angle of `k2,1`
(ISO 10846-1, 3.8): `eta = Im(k2,1) / Re(k2,1)`.

Two laboratory methods determine `k2,1`:

* **Direct method** (ISO 10846-2) — measure the blocked output force `F2,b`
  and the input displacement `u1` directly: `k2,1 = F2,b / u1`.
* **Indirect method** (ISO 10846-3) — load the output with a compact blocking
  mass `m2` and measure the vibration transmissibility `T = u2/u1`; the
  blocking force is the mass's inertia force (ISO 10846-3, Equation 1):

```text
k2,1 = -(2 pi f)**2 (m2 + mf) T          for  T << 1
```

  where `mf` is the mass of the output flange of the test element. The
  approximation is valid only where `|T| <= 0.1` (Inequality (2):
  `DeltaL1,2 >= 20 dB`) and while the blocking mass still behaves rigidly,
  `10 lg(m2,eff**2/m2**2) <= 1 dB` (Inequality (3)); see
  [`transfer_stiffness_indirect`](/phonometry/reference/api/vibration/transfer-stiffness/#transfer_stiffness_indirect).

The dynamic transfer stiffness is a member of the frequency-response-function
family (ISO 10846-1, Annex A / Table A.2): `k = j omega Z = -omega**2 m_eff`,
so it converts to mechanical impedance and effective mass through
[`phonometry.convert_frf`](/phonometry/reference/api/vibration/mechanical-mobility/#convert_frf) (`"dynamic_stiffness"` \<-> `"impedance"` \<->
`"apparent_mass"`). This module feeds the structure-borne source and building
prediction standards (ISO 9611, EN 15657, EN 12354-5).

## base_transmissibility

```python
base_transmissibility(
    frequency: ArrayLike,
    mass: float,
    stiffness: float,
    damping: float = 0.0,
) -> np.ndarray
```

Transmissibility of a mass on an ideal resilient element (model).

The output mass `m` on a massless Kelvin-Voigt element (spring `k` in
parallel with a viscous damper `c`) driven at the input has the
base-excitation transmissibility

`T = u2/u1 = (k + j omega c) / (k - omega**2 m + j omega c)`.

This ideal-element model is the counterpart of the indirect-method test
arrangement (ISO 10846-3): feeding `T` into [`transfer_stiffness_indirect`](/phonometry/reference/api/vibration/transfer-stiffness/#transfer_stiffness_indirect)
with the same mass recovers the element's transfer stiffness `k + j omega c`
in the high-frequency limit `T << 1`.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `frequency` | Frequency `f`, in hertz (scalar or array). |
| `mass` | Output mass `m`, in kg. |
| `stiffness` | Element stiffness `k`, in N/m. |
| `damping` | Viscous damping `c`, in N.s/m (Default: 0.0). |

**Returns:** The complex transmissibility `T`.

## blocking_force_ratio

```python
blocking_force_ratio(
    driving_point_stiffness: ArrayLike,
    termination_stiffness: ArrayLike,
) -> np.ndarray
```

Ratio of the delivered force to the blocking force (ISO 10846-1, Eq. 6).

For an isolator driving a receiving structure, the output force for a
given source displacement `u1` is `F2 = k2,1 u1 / (1 + k2,2/kt)`
(Equation (6)), where `k2,2` is the isolator's output driving-point
stiffness (output blocked at the input) and `kt` the dynamic
driving-point stiffness of the termination. This function returns

`F2 / F2,b = 1 / (1 + k2,2/kt)`

the factor by which the delivered force deviates from the blocking force
`F2,b = k2,1 u1` of Equation (7). For `|k2,2| < 0.1 |kt|` the ratio is
within 10 % of unity (`1/1.1 = 0.909` at the limit), which is the
stiffness mismatch that justifies characterising an isolator by its
blocked transfer stiffness alone.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `driving_point_stiffness` | Output driving-point stiffness `k2,2` of the isolator (complex, scalar or array), in N/m. |
| `termination_stiffness` | Driving-point stiffness `kt` of the receiving structure (complex, scalar or array, non-zero), in N/m. |

**Returns:** The complex ratio `F2/F2,b`.

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | for a zero termination stiffness. |

See [`transfer_stiffness_indirect`](/phonometry/reference/api/vibration/transfer-stiffness/#transfer_stiffness_indirect) for the ISO 10846-3 validity
conditions (Inequalities (2) and (3)); bands with `|T| > 0.1` trigger a

## loss_factor

```python
loss_factor(stiffness: ArrayLike) -> np.ndarray
```

Loss factor `eta = Im(k2,1) / Re(k2,1)` (ISO 10846-1, 3.8).

Valid in the low-frequency range where inertial forces in the element are
negligible; it is the tangent of the phase angle of the transfer stiffness.

**Returns:** The loss factor `eta` (dimensionless).

## REFERENCE_STIFFNESS

*Constant* (`float`).

```python
REFERENCE_STIFFNESS = 1.0
```

## transfer_stiffness_direct

```python
transfer_stiffness_direct(
    blocking_force: ArrayLike,
    input_displacement: ArrayLike,
) -> np.ndarray
```

Dynamic transfer stiffness by the direct method (ISO 10846-2).

`k2,1 = F2,b / u1` — the blocked output force phasor over the input
displacement phasor.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `blocking_force` | Blocked output force phasor `F2,b` (complex), in N. |
| `input_displacement` | Input displacement phasor `u1` (complex, non-zero), in m. |

**Returns:** The dynamic transfer stiffness `k2,1`, in N/m.

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | for a zero input displacement (dead input channel). |

## transfer_stiffness_indirect

```python
transfer_stiffness_indirect(
    frequency: ArrayLike,
    transmissibility: ArrayLike,
    blocking_mass: float,
    *,
    flange_mass: float = 0.0,
) -> np.ndarray
```

Dynamic transfer stiffness by the indirect method (ISO 10846-3, Eq. 1).

`k2,1 = -(2 pi f)**2 (m2 + mf) T` — the blocking force is the inertia
force of a compact blocking mass `m2` (plus the output flange mass
`mf`), derived from the measured vibration transmissibility `T = u2/u1`.
Valid for `T << 1` (i.e. well above the mass/spring resonance).

**Validity (ISO 10846-3, clause 6).** The `T << 1` approximation of
Formula (1) is required accurate within 1 dB, i.e. within 12 % of the
calculated stiffness magnitude. This holds only where Inequality (2) is
met: `DeltaL1,2 = La1 - La2 >= 20 dB`, i.e. `|T| <= 0.1`
([`TRANSMISSIBILITY_LIMIT`](/phonometry/reference/api/vibration/transfer-stiffness/#transmissibility_limit)). Bands with `|T|` above that limit —
routine near or below the mass/spring resonance — trigger a
[`PhonometryWarning`](/phonometry/reference/api/filters/phonometry/#phonometrywarning); treat those bands as outside the
valid frequency range of the test arrangement. The upper frequency limit
`f3` additionally requires the blocking mass to vibrate as a rigid
body: results are valid only while its effective mass `m2,eff`, measured
per Formula (4) as `m2,eff = 2 F2 / (a'1 + a''1)` (two accelerometers
spaced `D = sqrt(S)` across the contact area), stays within 1 dB of the
rigid mass, `10 lg(m2,eff**2 / m2**2) <= 1 dB` (Inequality (3), 6.2.3).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `frequency` | Frequency `f`, in hertz (scalar or array). |
| `transmissibility` | Vibration transmissibility `T = u2/u1` (complex, scalar or array; velocity and acceleration ratios have the same value). |
| `blocking_mass` | Blocking mass `m2`, in kg (> 0). |
| `flange_mass` | Output-flange mass `mf`, in kg (Default: 0.0). |

**Returns:** The dynamic transfer stiffness `k2,1`, in N/m.

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | for a non-positive frequency or blocking mass. |

**Warns**

| Warning | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| PhonometryWarning | where any `\|T\| > 0.1` (Inequality (2) violated). |

## transfer_stiffness_level

```python
transfer_stiffness_level(
    stiffness: ArrayLike,
    *,
    reference: float = 1.0,

```

**Returns:** The level `L_k`, in dB re `k0`.

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | for a non-positive reference or a zero stiffness magnitude (a dead channel has no level). |

    frequencies: np.ndarray,
    transfer_stiffness: np.ndarray,
    blocking_mass: float | None = None,
