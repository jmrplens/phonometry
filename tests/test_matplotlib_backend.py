"""
Tests ensuring the package treats matplotlib as the optional dependency it is.

Two promises are kept here. Importing phonometry must not force a specific
(e.g. non-interactive) backend, so the package can be used during interactive
exploration (IPython, Jupyter); see issue #52. And the base install must run on
NumPy and SciPy alone, so ``import phonometry`` has to succeed with matplotlib
absent, plotting failing only when a plot is actually asked for.
