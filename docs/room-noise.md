# Room-noise criteria (NC / RC Mark II)

Steady background noise in an occupied room (from ventilation, diffusers or
distant traffic) is rated against a family of **octave-band criterion curves**.
**ANSI/ASA S12.2-2019**, *Criteria for Evaluating Room Noise*, defines two
spectrum-in ratings that phonometry implements: the **Noise Criteria (NC)**
rating by the tangency method, and the **Room Criteria Mark II (RC)** rating
with its rumble/hiss spectral tag. Both work on octave-band sound pressure
levels over the ten bands from 16 Hz to 8000 Hz.

## 1. Noise Criteria: the tangency method

The **NC curves** (ANSI/ASA S12.2-2019 Table 1) are a family of octave-band
limits, each designated by its value at 1000 Hz (NC-15 up to NC-70). The
**tangency method** rates a measured spectrum by the value of the **highest NC
curve it touches**: for each octave band, the NC index whose curve passes
through the measured level is found, and the rating is the maximum across bands.
The band where that maximum occurs, the one that pushes the spectrum up against
the curves, is reported as the **governing band**.

```python
import numpy as np
from phonometry import room

# Octave-band SPL, 16 Hz - 8000 Hz (a ventilation-dominated room).
spl = np.array([62.0, 62.0, 59.0, 57.0, 52.0, 42.0, 35.0, 29.0, 24.0, 19.0])

nc = room.noise_criterion(spl)
print(round(nc.rating, 1))        # 42.5
print(nc.governing_frequency)     # 250.0  (the tangent band)
```

Because the rating interpolates between the tabulated curves it is a continuous
number: an NC rating of `42.5` sits half-way between NC-40 and NC-45. A subset
of the octave bands may be supplied together with their centre frequencies
(`room.noise_criterion(levels, frequencies)`), which is convenient when only the
speech-interference bands were measured.

## 2. Room Criteria Mark II: rating and spectral tag

The **RC Mark II** curves (ANSI/ASA S12.2-2019 Annex D, Table D.1) have a
constant slope of **−5 dB/octave**, keyed to their value at 1000 Hz, with the
16 Hz level equal to the 31.5 Hz level and a low-frequency floor of 55 dB.
The numerical rating is the **mid-frequency average** `LMF`, the mean of the
500, 1000 and 2000 Hz levels, rounded to the nearest decibel (clause D.4):

$$
\text{LMF} = \tfrac{1}{3}\left(L_{500} + L_{1000} + L_{2000}\right),
\qquad \text{RC} = \operatorname{round}(\text{LMF}).
$$

A **spectral tag** then describes the *character* of the noise by how the
spectrum deviates from the reference RC curve (clause D.3): **rumble** (`R`)
when a band at or below 500 Hz exceeds the curve by more than 5 dB, **hiss**
(`H`) when a band at or above 1000 Hz exceeds it by more than 3 dB, and
**neutral** (`N`) when neither happens.

```python
import numpy as np
from phonometry import room

spl = np.array([62.0, 62.0, 59.0, 57.0, 52.0, 42.0, 35.0, 29.0, 24.0, 19.0])

rc = room.room_criterion(spl)
print(rc.label)             # RC-35(R)   -  a rumbly room
print(round(rc.lmf, 1))     # 35.3
print(rc.classification)    # R
```

The strong low-frequency content of this spectrum lifts the 63–250 Hz bands
well above the reference curve, so the noise is tagged `R` (rumble): the
subjective "throb" of an oversized air handler.

The `NCResult` carries the `rating`, the `governing_frequency` and the measured
`levels`; the `RCResult` carries the `rating`, the `lmf`, the `classification`,
the `reference_curve` and a convenience `label` in the `RC-NN(A)` form. Each
exposes a `.plot()` that renders its panel above.

The balanced noise criteria (NCB), the room noise criterion for fluctuating
low-frequency noise (RNC, which needs a time series rather than a single
spectrum) and the numeric quality-assessment index (QAI, which the standard
defers to external references) are not part of this module.

## 3. Choosing a criterion: NC, RC Mark II or NR

The two ratings answer different questions, and a third family exists that
this module deliberately does not implement:

- **NC** answers *"does the room meet its limit, and which band breaks
  it?"*. It is the compliance rating of North-American practice
  (specifications, codes, equipment schedules), and the tangency method is
  driven entirely by the single governing band. That is also its blind
  spot: two NC-40 rooms can sound completely different, one rumbly and one
  hissy, because tangency says nothing about spectral balance. Use NC when
  a specification cites it, and always report the governing band with the
  rating, since it names the octave any fix must attack first.
- **RC Mark II** answers *"how does the room sound, and what should be
  fixed?"*. Its rating tracks speech interference through the
  mid-frequency average, and its reference slope of −5 dB per octave is
  the spectrum occupants describe as neutral, a bland ventilation
  background that is neither boomy nor sharp. The spectral tag then points
  at the offending frequency range. Reach for RC Mark II at HVAC design
  time, or to diagnose an installation that fails its NC limit.
- **NR (Noise Rating)**, the curve family of Kosten & van Os (1962), is
  the European counterpart of NC: the same tangency logic over a
  slightly different curve family (more permissive
  at low frequency, stricter at high), common in European and
  international equipment and building specifications. phonometry does not
  implement NR; when a specification cites NR, rate against the NR curves
  themselves rather than substituting NC, because the two families diverge
  by several decibels away from the mid frequencies.

**Reading the tag.** The RC Mark II tag is a repair hint, not just a label.
A rumble tag (`R`, more than 5 dB over the reference at or below 500 Hz)
points at the air-handling plant: an oversized or starved fan, duct
rumble, or structure-borne vibration re-radiated by walls, and it is the
low-frequency energy that rattles lightweight construction and fatigues
occupants. A hiss tag (`H`, more than 3 dB over at or above 1000 Hz)
points at the terminal end: diffuser and grille face velocities or a
throttled damper close to the outlet, and it is the range that masks
speech. A neutral tag (`N`) means the level can still be wrong, but the
character is right: reduce the whole spectrum rather than reshape it.

## 4. Room-noise reports (`.report()`)

Both ratings render a one-page PDF room-noise assessment fiche. `NCResult.report(path)`
and `RCResult.report(path)` share the same layout: a standard-basis line, an
optional metadata header block, the measured octave-band levels beside the
measured spectrum plotted against the NC/RC curve family (the result's own
`.plot()`), the boxed rating, an optional verdict row and a footer with the
fixed disclaimer. The NC box shows `NC-nn` with its governing band; the RC box
shows `RC-nn(tag)` with the mid-frequency average $L_\text{MF}$ and the spectral
quality. A lower rating is quieter, so a `requirement` on the metadata (read as
the maximum acceptable NC or RC rating) passes at or below the target. Setting
`verbose=True` adds the per-band NC contour value read by the tangency method
(NC), or the reference RC Mark II curve and the measured deviation from it (RC).
Both use the same `ReportMetadata` container as the other fiches; the
room-specific `room_volume` and `area` populate the header alongside `client`,
`test_room`, `specimen`, `instrumentation`, the climate fields,
`measurement_standard`, `test_date`, `laboratory`, `operator` and `report_id`.
Passing `metadata=None` produces a bare assessment fiche. Rendering needs
reportlab (`pip install phonometry[report]`); only `engine="reportlab"` is
supported, and `language="es"` renders a Spanish fiche (translated fixed strings
and a comma decimal separator).

```python
import numpy as np
from phonometry import room, ReportMetadata

spl = np.array([79.0, 69.0, 59.0, 51.0, 50.0, 39.0, 36.0, 34.0, 33.0, 32.0])
metadata = ReportMetadata(
    test_room="Office A", room_volume=180.0, area=60.0,
    measurement_standard="ANSI/ASA S12.2",
    laboratory="Phonometry Reference Laboratory",
    requirement=40.0,              # adds a verdict against a target rating
)
room.noise_criterion(spl).report("nc_fiche.pdf", metadata=metadata)
room.room_criterion(spl).report("rc_fiche.pdf", metadata=metadata)
```
