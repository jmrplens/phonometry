r"""Range-marching ray integration with specular boundaries (private).

In a range-independent medium the horizontal slowness
:math:`\xi = \cos\theta_0 / c(z_0)` is invariant along a ray, so with the
vertical slowness :math:`\zeta = \sin\theta / c` the trajectory marches in
range as

.. math::

    \frac{dz}{dr} = \frac{\zeta}{\xi}, \qquad
    \frac{d\zeta}{dr} = -\frac{dc/dz}{c^3 \xi}, \qquad
    \frac{dt}{dr} = \frac{1}{\xi c^2},

the travel time being a third state of the very step that places the ray rather
than a quadrature run over the finished path.

Those are the equations behind
:func:`phonometry.underwater.propagation.numerical.ray_trace`, and the same ones
behind the atmospheric
:func:`phonometry.environment.propagation.refraction.atmospheric_ray_paths`;
only the profile and the reflecting boundaries differ, the ocean being a slab
between the sea surface and the bottom and the atmosphere a half space bounded
by the ground alone. This module owns the marcher, and takes both as arguments:
the caller supplies its own derivative (hence its own profile) and its own
boundaries.

``z`` is whichever coordinate the caller measures across the medium, positive
depth downward for the ocean and positive height upward for the atmosphere; the
marcher only needs the boundaries to be given in the same one.

Dynamic ray tracing
-------------------

A ray path on its own carries no amplitude: the amplitude lives in how fast the
tube between neighbouring rays opens, which is a second pair of states obeying
the *dynamic* ray equations (Jensen Eq. 3.58)

.. math::

    \frac{dq}{ds} = c\,p, \qquad \frac{dp}{ds} = -\frac{c_{nn}}{c^2}\,q,

with :math:`q` the ray-tube spreading, tied to the Jacobian of the ray
coordinates by :math:`r\,q(s) = J(s)` (Eq. 3.64), and :math:`c_{nn}` the
curvature of the sound speed across the ray (Eq. 3.62). In a range-independent
medium the two cross terms of Eq. (3.62) vanish and it collapses to
:math:`c_{nn} = c^2 \xi^2 c''(z)`; dividing by :math:`dr/ds = c\,\xi` puts the
pair in the marcher's own variable next to the three above,

.. math::

    \frac{dq}{dr} = \frac{p}{\xi}, \qquad
    \frac{dp}{dr} = -\xi\,\frac{c''(z)}{c(z)}\,q .

Both callers interpolate their profile piecewise linearly, so :math:`c''` is
zero throughout every segment and a Dirac delta at every node. That is not a
detail to gloss over: run a Runge-Kutta step over such a profile and every
stage samples :math:`c'' = 0`, so ``p`` comes out constant and ``q`` linear, and
the field one would build from it is free-space spreading with the refraction
quietly deleted from the amplitude. The deltas have to be integrated as what
they are, an impulsive change in ``p`` each time the ray crosses a node
(Jensen Sect. 3.6.4). Between nodes the pair is then exact rather than
fourth-order accurate: ``p`` is constant and ``q`` is a straight line in range,
which is what a Runge-Kutta step would return anyway, to the last bit.

The impulse comes from the weak-interface formulas of Eqs. (3.129)-(3.130),
:math:`p^T = p^I + q^I N`, :math:`q^T = q^I` with
:math:`N = -M(2[c_\mathrm{n}] - M[c_\mathrm{s}])/c^2` and
:math:`M = \beta/\alpha`. With a flat interface and a range-independent
profile, the ray tangent and normal of Eqs. (3.25)-(3.26) give
:math:`c_\mathrm{n} = c\,c_z\,\xi`, :math:`c_\mathrm{s} = c\,c_z\,\zeta` and
:math:`M = \xi/\zeta`, and the whole of Eq. (3.130) collapses to one scalar:

.. math::

    q \mapsto q, \qquad
    p \mapsto p - \xi^2\,\frac{[dc/dz]}{|\zeta|\,c(z_k)}\,q ,

with :math:`[dc/dz]` the jump in the gradient across the node, the segment
below minus the segment above. Taking the jump in that fixed sense and dividing
by :math:`|\zeta|` rather than :math:`\zeta` makes the rule reciprocal, the same
impulse for a ray crossing upward as downward, which it must be. Integrating
the delta directly, :math:`\int c''\,dr = (\xi/|\zeta|)\,[dc/dz]` across the
crossing, reproduces it independently.

A specular reflection is the same formula with a curvature term, Eqs.
(3.122)-(3.123), and for the flat surface and flat bottom here the curvature
vanishes and it reduces to :math:`p \mapsto p + 2\xi^2 (dc/dz)\,q/(\zeta\,c)`
with :math:`\zeta` the *signed* incident vertical slowness. That is the rule
above with an effective jump of :math:`+2\,dc/dz` at the lower boundary and
:math:`-2\,dc/dz` at the upper one, which is exactly what the mirrored profile
of the image medium presents to a ray crossing the boundary, so the marcher
applies one rule at all three kinds of level. In particular an isovelocity
layer against a boundary leaves the pair untouched, as the image-source
construction requires.

Which of the two a level is depends on the medium and not on where the profile
happens to stop. The ocean's profile ends on its two boundaries, so its end
nodes are reflections; the atmosphere's ends in mid air with nothing above it
but the homogeneous half space the clamped interpolation of the sound speed
implies, so its last node is an interface, and a ray that climbs out through it
takes the plain gradient jump on the way.

Carrying the pair is opt-in (``dynamic=`` on :func:`march_rays`), for two
reasons worth stating rather than leaving to be discovered. It costs the
atmospheric tracer, which has no use for an amplitude, nothing at all. And
landing sub-steps on the profile nodes, which the impulses require, subdivides
steps that were previously taken whole, so a run with the pair returns a
slightly different (better resolved) trajectory than one without; a solver that
wants an amplitude has to trace geometry and amplitude together, in one call,
so that the amplitude is the Jacobian of the rays it is handed alongside.

One thing the splitting does not buy back, and it is worth putting numbers to.
The last Runge-Kutta stage of the sub-step that *arrives* at a node is evaluated
at the node itself, on one side or the other of the kink, and whichever side the
caller resolves the tie to, that stage is integrated with a gradient that does
not hold over all of the sub-step it closes: one stage of first-order error per
crossing, inside an otherwise fourth-order step. It is much the smaller half of
the problem, the alternative being a whole step integrated with the gradient of
one segment while the ray spends part of it in the next. But it lands in
``zeta`` at the crossing, and by an absolute amount that barely depends on how
steeply the ray meets the kink, while the impulse divides by ``|zeta|``: what
reaches the amplitude is therefore that fixed error measured against a vertical
slowness which vanishes as the crossing turns tangential.

The size of it, on a thermocline kinking from +0.10 to -0.11 s^-1 over a 4 km
path, with ``q`` measured against the ray family of an independently integrated
fan. A ray meeting that node a hundredth of a degree past grazing, ``|zeta|`` =
4.3e-6 s/m, is out by 2.5e-2 at a 10 m range step, 7.3e-3 at 2.5 m and 2.9e-4 at
0.6 m; one meeting the same node at 20 degrees, ``|zeta|`` fifty times larger, is
out by 7.6e-5 at that same 10 m step. The two absolute errors in
``zeta`` differ by less than a factor of two, and in the near-tangential case
the relative error in ``q`` tracks the relative error in ``zeta`` to within a few
per cent of itself, that one impulse being large enough to swamp everything else
along the path. So it converges, at first order and with a scatter set by where
in the step the crossing happens to fall, which makes it an accuracy limit
rather than a wrong answer; but it is largest exactly where a beam solver most
needs ``q``, at the edge of a duct or on the approach to a caustic, and the
range step is the only handle a caller has on it.
