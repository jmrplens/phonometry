Reactive silencers by the four-pole (transmission-matrix) method.

A reactive silencer controls noise by *reflecting* it back to the source with
impedance discontinuities -- sudden area changes and side branches -- rather
than by dissipating it in absorptive material. The one-dimensional plane-wave
theory represents each acoustic element by a 2x2 **transfer (four-pole)
matrix** relating the sound pressure ``p`` and volume velocity ``S u`` at its
two ends, and a compound silencer is the ordered matrix product of its
elements (Bies, Hansen & Howard, *Engineering Noise Control* 5th ed., §8.8-8.9;
Munjal, *Acoustics of Ducts and Mufflers*).

**Transfer matrix** (Bies Eq. (8.133)), state vector ``[p, S u]`` with the
characteristic acoustic impedance ``Z = rho c / S``. The plane-wave element for
a straight duct of length ``L`` and area ``S`` is (Bies Eq. (8.143), no flow)

    [[ cos(kL),              j (rho c / S) sin(kL) ],
     [ j (S / rho c) sin(kL), cos(kL)              ]],    k = omega / c,

and a **side branch** of acoustic impedance ``Z_b`` is the shunt element
(Bies Eq. (8.144))

    [[ 1,       0 ],
     [ 1 / Z_b, 1 ]].

**Transmission loss** from the compound matrix ``T`` (Munjal, *Acoustics of
Ducts and Mufflers* 2nd ed., Eq. (3.27), no flow; reduces to Bies Eq. (8.148)
for equal inlet/outlet areas):

    TL = 10 log10[ (Zn / Z1) (1/4) | T11 + T12 / Zn + Z1 T21 + (Z1 / Zn) T22 |^2 ]

with ``Z1 = rho c / S_in`` and ``Zn = rho c / S_out``. A zero-length element
between unequal areas then reproduces the classic sudden-expansion result
``TL = 10 log10[(1 + m)^2 / (4 m)]`` with ``m = S_out / S_in``, and the TL is
the same from either side, as reciprocity of a passive two-port requires.
Bies Eq. (8.141) prints this formula with impedance ratios on ``T11`` and
``T22`` (``Z_A1/Z_An`` and ``Z_An/Z_A1``) instead of the overall ``Zn/Z1``
prefactor; as printed it fails the sudden-expansion limit (see
``docs/ERRATA.md``). ``TL`` is the intrinsic attenuation for an anechoic
termination. The **insertion loss** for a source of internal impedance
``Z_s`` radiating into a termination impedance ``Z_r`` is the extra
attenuation of inserting the silencer in place of a direct connection,

    IL = 20 log10 | (T11 Z_r + T12 + Z_s Z_r T21 + Z_s T22) / (Z_s + Z_r) |,

which is ``0`` when the silencer reduces to a through connection (``T = I``)
and, for equal inlet/outlet areas, equals the transmission loss for the
anechoic reference ``Z_s = Z_r = rho c / S`` (with unequal areas the direct
connection contains the same area jump, so its mismatch loss cancels from
the insertion loss but not from the transmission loss).

**Simple expansion chamber.** A chamber of area ``S_exp`` and length ``L``
between pipes of area ``S_duct`` has the closed-form transmission loss (Bies
Eq. (8.111)) with area ratio ``m = S_exp / S_duct``

    TL = 10 log10[ 1 + (1/4) (m - 1/m)^2 sin^2(kL) ],

peaking at ``10 log10[1 + (1/4)(m - 1/m)^2]`` when ``kL = pi/2, 3pi/2, ...`` and
dropping to ``0`` at ``kL = n pi`` (no dissipation). The four-pole product
reproduces this exactly, and the machinery extends to side-branch (Helmholtz,
quarter-wave) and extended-tube resonators that the closed form cannot cover.
