Field airborne sound insulation (ISO 16283-1:2014) and impact sound
insulation (ISO 16283-2), with single-number weighted ratings and
spectrum adaptation terms (ISO 717-1 airborne, ISO 717-2 impact).

**Field quantities (ISO 16283-1:2014).** From the energy-average sound
pressure levels in the source and receiving rooms this module forms the
level difference ``D = L1 - L2`` (Clause 3.12, Formula (1)), the
standardized level difference ``DnT = D + 10 lg(T/T0)`` with the
reference reverberation time ``T0 = 0,5 s`` (Clause 3.13, Formula (2)),
and the apparent sound reduction index
``R' = D + 10 lg(S/A)`` with the Sabine equivalent absorption area
``A = 0,16 V / T`` (Clause 3.14/3.15, Formula (4) and (5)). Source and
receiving levels may be supplied already averaged (one value per band) or
as several microphone positions, which are then energy-averaged with
``10 lg( (1/n) sum 10^(Li/10) )`` (Clause 7.8, Formula (9)). All
quantities are evaluated per one-third-octave band over the core range
100 Hz to 3150 Hz (Clause 5), the caller having already applied any
background-noise correction (Clause 9.2).

**Weighted rating (ISO 717-1).** The reference-curve method of Clause 4.4
shifts the reference curve of Table 3 in 1 dB steps towards the measured
curve until the sum of unfavourable deviations (measured below the
shifted reference) is as large as possible but not more than 32,0 dB for
the 16 one-third-octave bands (100 Hz to 3150 Hz) or 10,0 dB for the 5
octave bands (125 Hz to 2000 Hz). The weighted rating (``Rw``, ``R'w``,
``Dn,w``, ``DnT,w`` ...) is the shifted reference read at 500 Hz. The
spectrum adaptation terms are ``C = XA1 - Xw`` and ``Ctr = XA2 - Xw``
with ``XAj = -10 lg sum 10^((Lij - Xi)/10)`` rounded to an integer, using
the A-weighted spectra No. 1 (pink noise, ``C``) and No. 2 (urban traffic,
``Ctr``) of Table 4 (Clause 4.5, Formula (1) and (2)). Input levels are
reduced to one decimal place before use (Clause 4.4, footnote 1). The
reference values, spectra and shifting rule are identical in the 2013 and
2020 editions of ISO 717-1.

**Enlarged frequency ranges (ISO 717-1 Annex B; ISO 717-2 A.2.1 NOTE).**
When measurements cover an enlarged range, additional adaptation terms are
stated with the range as a subscript: ``C50-3150``, ``C50-5000``,
``C100-5000`` (and the ``Ctr`` counterparts) with the Table B.1 spectra, and
``CI,50-2500`` for impact. :func:`weighted_rating_extended` and
:func:`weighted_impact_rating_extended` compute them alongside the core
rating. Both accept ``one_decimal=True`` for the "1/10 dB for the expression
of uncertainty" variant of Clauses 4.4/4.5 (reference-curve shift in 0,1 dB
steps and one-decimal reductions), which ISO 12999-1:2020 Annex B requires
when stating the uncertainty of single-number values.

**Field impact quantities (ISO 16283-2).** With the tapping machine as the
impact source this module forms, from the energy-average impact sound
pressure level ``Li`` in the receiving room, the standardized impact sound
pressure level ``L'nT = Li - 10 lg(T/T0)`` with ``T0 = 0,5 s`` (Clause
3.13, Formula (1)) and the normalized impact sound pressure level
``L'n = Li + 10 lg(A/A0)`` with the Sabine absorption area ``A = 0,16 V/T``
and the reference area ``A0 = 10 m²`` (Clause 3.14, Formula (2)). Levels
may be supplied already averaged or as several microphone positions, then
energy-averaged (Clause 7.8, Formula (10)), over the core one-third-octave
range 100 Hz to 3150 Hz (Clause 5.1).

**Field façade quantities (ISO 16283-3:2016).** With an outdoor sound
source this module forms, from the level 2 m in front of the façade
``L1,2m`` and the receiving-room level ``L2``, the level difference
``D2m = L1,2m - L2`` (Clause 3.14), its standardized form
``D2m,nT = D2m + 10 lg(T/T0)`` with ``T0 = 0,5 s`` (Clause 3.15) and
normalized form ``D2m,n = D2m - 10 lg(A/A0)`` with the Sabine absorption
area ``A = 0,16 V/T`` (Clause 3.17) and reference ``A0 = 10 m²``
(Clause 3.16): the global loudspeaker / traffic quantities
``Dls,2m,*`` / ``Dtr,2m,*``. When a surface level ``L1,s`` (microphone on
the test element) with the element area ``S`` and volume are given it
forms the apparent sound reduction index
``R'45° = L1,s - L2 + 10 lg(S/A) - 1,5`` for the loudspeaker element method
(Clause 3.12) or ``R'tr,s = L1,s - L2 + 10 lg(S/A) - 3`` for the
road-traffic element method (Clause 3.13). These quantities are defined by
unnumbered formulas inline in the Clause 3 terms; positions are
energy-averaged with the surface-level formula (Clause 9.5.1, Formula (7)).
Quantities are evaluated over the core one-third-octave range 100 Hz to
3150 Hz (Clause 5), optionally extended to 50-5000 Hz. The façade quantity
is airborne, so its single-number rating uses the **ISO 717-1 airborne**
reference curve and method (Clause 2, Annex F) via :func:`weighted_rating`
unchanged.

**Weighted impact rating (ISO 717-2).** The reference-curve method of
Clause 4.3 shifts the Table 3 impact reference curve towards the measured
curve until the sum of unfavourable deviations (here where the
**measurement exceeds** the reference, the sign opposite to airborne) is
as large as possible but not more than 32,0 dB (16 one-third-octave bands)
or 10,0 dB (5 octave bands). The rating (``Ln,w``, ``L'n,w``, ``L'nT,w``)
is the shifted reference read at 500 Hz, reduced by a further 5 dB for
octave bands (Clause 4.3.2). The spectrum adaptation term
``CI = Ln,sum - 15 - Ln,w`` uses the energetic sum ``Ln,sum`` over
100 Hz to 2500 Hz (one-third octave) or 125 Hz to 2000 Hz (octave),
rounded to an integer (Clause A.2.1, Formulae (A.1) to (A.3)). The Table 3
reference values, the shifting rule and CI are identical in the 2013 and
2020 editions of ISO 717-2 (the 2020 edition only adds Annex D for the
rubber-ball heavy/soft impactor, out of scope here).
