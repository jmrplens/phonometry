Outdoor sound propagation: ISO 9613-2:1996 general method of calculation.

This part of ISO 9613 predicts octave-band attenuation of sound propagating
outdoors from a point source to a receiver under conditions favourable to
propagation (moderate downwind, or the equivalent moderate temperature
inversion; ISO 9613-2:1996, clause 5). The equivalent-continuous downwind
octave-band sound pressure level is (ISO 9613-2:1996, Eq. (3)):

```text
LfT(DW) = Lw + Dc - A
```

with `Lw` the octave-band sound power level, `Dc` the directivity correction
(directivity index plus a solid-angle index `DOmega`) and `A` the octave-band
attenuation, itself a sum of physical mechanisms (Eq. (4)):

```text
A = Adiv + Aatm + Agr + Abar + Amisc
```

Implemented here are the four general terms of clause 7:

* `Adiv` geometrical divergence, `20 lg(d/d0) + 11` (Eq. (7));
* `Aatm` atmospheric absorption, `alpha * d` (Eq. (8)) with `alpha` the
  ISO 9613-1 coefficient supplied by [`phonometry.air_absorption`](/phonometry/reference/api/environment/air-absorption/);
* `Agr` ground effect, both the general per-region method of 7.3.1 with the
  Table 3 functions `a'/b'/c'/d'` (Eq. (9)) and the alternative simplified
  method of 7.3.2 (Eq. (10));
* `Abar` screening by a barrier, `Dz - Agr` with the `Dz` diffraction
  formula of Eq. (14) including the `C2`/`C3` factors, the pathlength
  difference `z` (Eq. (16)/(17)), the meteorological factor `Kmet`
  (Eq. (18)) and the 20 dB (single) / 25 dB (double) limits.

The long-term average level follows from the meteorological correction `Cmet`
(Eq. (6), (21), (22), clause 8). `Amisc` (foliage, industrial sites, housing;
annex A) and reflections from vertical obstacles (clause 7.5) are informative and
left to the caller. Accuracy of the method is stated in Table 5 (clause 9): within
+/-1 dB to +/-3 dB for broadband noise up to 1000 m.

## atmospheric_absorption

```python
atmospheric_absorption(
    distance: float,
    frequencies: ArrayLike = (63.0, 125.0, 250.0, 500.0, 1000.0, 2000.0, 4000.0, 8000.0),
    temperature: float = 20.0,
    relative_humidity: float | None = None,
    pressure: float = 101.325,
    *,
    humidity: float | str = 'deprecated',
) -> NDArray[np.float64]
```

Attenuation due to atmospheric absorption (ISO 9613-2:1996, Eq. (8)).

`Aatm = alpha * d` with `alpha` the ISO 9613-1 atmospheric attenuation
coefficient (here in dB/m, from [`phonometry.air_absorption.air_attenuation`](/phonometry/reference/api/environment/air-absorption/#air_attenuation))
at each octave-band midband frequency. Eq. (8) writes `alpha` in dB/km with
`Aatm = alpha_dBkm * d / 1000`; the two forms are identical.

`alpha` is evaluated at the *exact* base-10 midband frequency behind
each nominal band label (e.g. 7 943.3 Hz for the "8 kHz" band), the
convention behind the ISO 9613-2 Table 2 coefficients (they come from
ISO 9613-1 Table 1 at exact midbands; at 8 kHz the nominal-frequency
evaluation would run ~1.3 % high). Each supplied frequency is snapped to
the nearest exact midband.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `distance` | Source-to-receiver distance `d`, in metres. |
| `frequencies` | Octave-band midband frequencies, in hertz. |
| `temperature` | Air temperature, in degrees Celsius. |
| `relative_humidity` | Relative humidity, in percent (default 70). |
| `pressure` | Atmospheric pressure, in kilopascals. |
| `humidity` | Deprecated alias of `relative_humidity` (remove in 4.0). |

**Returns:** `Aatm` per band, in decibels.

## Barrier

```python
Barrier(
    source_to_edge: float,
    edge_to_receiver: float,
    parallel_distance: float = 0.0,
    edge_separation: float | None = None,
    ground_reflections_by_image: bool = False,
    lateral: bool = False,
    line_of_sight_clear: bool = False,
)
```

Screening obstacle for the ISO 9613-2 barrier term (clause 7.4).

The barrier is described by the diffraction geometry that feeds the
pathlength-difference equations (16)/(17) directly, which is the cleanest
match to the `Dz` formula of Eq. (14).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `source_to_edge` | Distance `dss` from the source to the (first) diffraction edge, in metres (ISO 9613-2:1996, Eq. (16)). |
| `edge_to_receiver` | Distance `dsr` from the (second) diffraction edge to the receiver, in metres. |
| `parallel_distance` | Component `a` of the source-receiver separation parallel to the barrier edge, in metres (0 for a purely 2-D section). |
| `edge_separation` | Spacing `e` between the two diffraction edges for double (thick-barrier) diffraction, in metres; `None` selects single diffraction (Eq. (16), `C3 = 1`). When given, Eq. (17) and the `C3` factor of Eq. (15) are used with the 25 dB limit. |
| `ground_reflections_by_image` | When `True` the ground reflections are assumed to be handled separately by image sources, so `C2 = 40`; otherwise `C2 = 20` (Eq. (14)). |
| `lateral` | When `True` the diffraction is around a vertical edge (Eq. (13)): `Abar = Dz` (the ground term is not cancelled) and `Kmet = 1`. Default `False` selects top-edge diffraction (Eq. (12)). |
| `line_of_sight_clear` | When `True` the line of sight between source and receiver passes *above* the top edge: ISO 9613-2:1996 (text after Eq. (16)) then gives the path difference `z` a negative sign, and Eq. (14) is still evaluated (with `Kmet = 1`, Eq. (18)), so `Dz` falls continuously from `10 lg 3 = 4.8 dB` at grazing to 0 for deeper geometries. The edge distances stay the unsigned geometric lengths; only the sign convention of `z` changes. |

Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.

### Barrier.is_double

*property*

Whether double diffraction (Eq. (17)/(15)) applies (`e` given).

## barrier_attenuation

```python
barrier_attenuation(
    barrier: Barrier,
    distance: float,
    frequencies: ArrayLike = (63.0, 125.0, 250.0, 500.0, 1000.0, 2000.0, 4000.0, 8000.0),
) -> NDArray[np.float64]
```

Barrier diffraction attenuation `Dz` (ISO 9613-2:1996, Eq. (14)).

```text
Dz = 10 lg[ 3 + (C2/lambda) C3 z Kmet ]   dB
```

with `C2 = 20` (or 40 when ground reflections are handled by image
sources), `C3 = 1` for single diffraction or Eq. (15) for double, the
pathlength difference `z` (Eq. (16)/(17)), `lambda = 340/f` and the
meteorological factor `Kmet` (Eq. (18), 1 for `z <= 0`). `Dz` is
limited to 20 dB (single) or 25 dB (double). When the line of sight passes
above the top edge (`Barrier(line_of_sight_clear=True)`) `z` takes a
negative sign (ISO 9613-2:1996, text after Eq. (16)) and Eq. (14) still
applies: `Dz` falls continuously from `10 lg 3 = 4.8 dB` at grazing
(`z = 0`) towards 0 as the clearance deepens, clamped at 0 (the
logarithm's argument is floored at 1 -- a barrier below the sight line
never amplifies).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `barrier` | Barrier geometry ([`Barrier`](/phonometry/reference/api/environment/outdoor-propagation/#barrier)). |
| `distance` | Straight-line source-to-receiver distance `d`, in metres. |

**Returns:** `Dz` per band, in decibels (>= 0).

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |

```

## directivity_omega

```python
directivity_omega(
    source_height: float,
    receiver_height: float,
    projected_distance: float,
) -> float
```

Solid-angle directivity index `DOmega` (ISO 9613-2:1996, Eq. (11)).

Accounts for the apparent increase in source power from ground reflection near
the source when the alternative ground method (Eq. (10)) is used:

```text
DOmega = 10 lg{ 1 + [dp^2 + (hs - hr)^2] / [dp^2 + (hs + hr)^2] }   dB
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |

## geometric_divergence

```python
geometric_divergence(distance: float) -> float
```

Attenuation due to geometrical divergence (ISO 9613-2:1996, Eq. (7)).

Spherical spreading in the free field from a point source:

```text
Adiv = 20 lg(d/d0) + 11   dB ,   d0 = 1 m
```

The `+11` (= `10 lg 4pi`) sets the sound pressure level at the reference
distance `d0 = 1 m` from an omnidirectional point source (Note 7).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `distance` | Straight-line source-to-receiver distance `d`, in metres. |

**Returns:** `Adiv`, in decibels (51 dB at 100 m, 11 dB at 1 m).

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | If `distance` is not positive. |

## ground_attenuation

```python
ground_attenuation(
    distance: float,
    source_height: float,
    receiver_height: float,
    frequencies: ArrayLike = (63.0, 125.0, 250.0, 500.0, 1000.0, 2000.0, 4000.0, 8000.0),
    ground_source: float = 0.0,
    ground_middle: float = 0.0,
    ground_receiver: float = 0.0,
    projected_distance: float | None = None,
) -> NDArray[np.float64]
```

Ground attenuation by the general per-region method (7.3.1, Eq. (9)).

`Agr = As + Ar + Am` (source, receiver and middle regions), each evaluated
with the Table 3 expressions and its ground factor `G` (0 = hard, 1 =
porous, in between = porous fraction). For the source region `G = Gs` and
`h = hs`; for the receiver region `G = Gr` and `h = hr` (Table 3,
note 1). The middle-region term uses the overlap factor `q` of note 2:

```text
q = 0                       if dp <= 30(hs + hr)
q = 1 - 30(hs + hr)/dp      if dp > 30(hs + hr)
```

with `Am = -3q` at 63 Hz and `Am = -3q(1 - Gm)` above.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `distance` | Straight-line source-to-receiver distance `d`, in metres. |
| `source_height` | Source height `hs` above ground, in metres. |
| `receiver_height` | Receiver height `hr` above ground, in metres. |
| `frequencies` | Octave-band midband frequencies, in hertz. Table 3 is defined for the eight nominal octave bands 63 Hz-8 kHz only; any other requested frequency is snapped to the nearest nominal octave band for the Table 3 lookup. |
| `ground_source` | Ground factor `Gs` of the source region ([0, 1]). |
| `ground_middle` | Ground factor `Gm` of the middle region ([0, 1]). |
| `ground_receiver` | Ground factor `Gr` of the receiver region ([0, 1]). |
| `projected_distance` | Ground-plane projected distance `dp`, in metres; defaults to `sqrt(d^2 - (hs - hr)^2)`. |

**Returns:** `Agr` per band, in decibels (negative denotes a net gain).

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | If a ground factor is outside `[0, 1]`, `distance` is not positive, a height is negative, or a frequency is not positive. |

## ground_attenuation_alternative

```python
ground_attenuation_alternative(distance: float, mean_height: float) -> float
```

Ground attenuation by the alternative A-weighted method (7.3.2, Eq. (10)).

Valid only when only the A-weighted receiver level is of interest, the sound
propagates over porous or mostly-porous ground and is not a pure tone
(ISO 9613-2:1996, 7.3.2):

```text
Agr = 4,8 - (2 hm / d) [17 + (300 / d)]   >= 0   dB
```

Negative results are replaced by zero. When this method is used, add the
solid-angle index [`directivity_omega`](/phonometry/reference/api/environment/outdoor-propagation/#directivity_omega) (Eq. (11)) to `Dc` in Eq. (3).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `distance` | Source-to-receiver distance `d`, in metres. |
| `mean_height` | Mean height `hm` of the propagation path above the ground (`hm = F/d`, figure 3), in metres. |

**Returns:** `Agr`, in decibels (>= 0).

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | If `distance` is not positive. |

## meteorological_correction

```python
meteorological_correction(
    projected_distance: float,
    source_height: float,
    receiver_height: float,
    c0: float,
) -> float
```

Meteorological correction `Cmet` (ISO 9613-2:1996, Eq. (21)/(22)).

```text
Cmet = 0                             if dp <= 10(hs + hr)
Cmet = C0 [1 - 10(hs + hr)/dp]       if dp >  10(hs + hr)
```

`C0` (dB) reflects local wind and temperature-gradient statistics; practical
values lie in 0..~5 dB (note 22). Subtract `Cmet` from `LAT(DW)` for the
long-term average level (Eq. (6)).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `projected_distance` | Ground-plane projected distance `dp`, in metres. |
| `source_height` | Source height `hs`, in metres. |
| `receiver_height` | Receiver height `hr`, in metres. |
| `c0` | Meteorological factor `C0`, in decibels. |

**Returns:** `Cmet`, in decibels (>= 0 for `C0 >= 0`).

## outdoor_propagation_attenuation

```python
outdoor_propagation_attenuation(
    distance: float,
    source_height: float,
    receiver_height: float,
    frequencies: ArrayLike = (63.0, 125.0, 250.0, 500.0, 1000.0, 2000.0, 4000.0, 8000.0),
    ground_source: float = 0.0,
    ground_middle: float = 0.0,
    ground_receiver: float = 0.0,
    barrier: Barrier | None = None,
    temperature: float = 20.0,
    relative_humidity: float | None = None,
    pressure: float = 101.325,
    projected_distance: float | None = None,
    *,
    humidity: float | str = 'deprecated',
) -> OutdoorAttenuation
```

Total octave-band outdoor attenuation (ISO 9613-2:1996, Eq. (4)).

Assembles the four general terms of clause 7 into `A = Adiv + Aatm + Agr +
Abar` (the informative `Amisc` is omitted). The ground effect uses the
general per-region method (7.3.1). With a barrier, the top-edge insertion loss
`Abar = Dz - Agr` (Eq. (12)) folds the ground effect of the screened path
into `Dz` (note 13); for a lateral (vertical-edge) barrier `Abar = Dz`
(Eq. (13)) and the ground term is retained.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `distance` | Straight-line source-to-receiver distance `d`, in metres. |
| `source_height` | Source height `hs` above ground, in metres. |
| `receiver_height` | Receiver height `hr` above ground, in metres. |
| `frequencies` | Octave-band midband frequencies, in hertz. The ground term snaps each frequency to the nearest nominal octave band (Table 3 is octave-band only) and the atmospheric term evaluates the exact base-10 midband behind it (see [`atmospheric_absorption`](/phonometry/reference/api/environment/outdoor-propagation/#atmospheric_absorption)). |
| `ground_source` | Ground factor `Gs` of the source region ([0, 1], 0 = hard, 1 = porous). |
| `ground_middle` | Ground factor `Gm` of the middle region ([0, 1]). |
| `ground_receiver` | Ground factor `Gr` of the receiver region ([0, 1]). |
| `barrier` | Optional screening obstacle ([`Barrier`](/phonometry/reference/api/environment/outdoor-propagation/#barrier)). |
| `temperature` | Air temperature, in degrees Celsius. |
| `relative_humidity` | Relative humidity, in percent (default 70). |
| `pressure` | Atmospheric pressure, in kilopascals. |
| `projected_distance` | Ground-plane projected distance `dp`, in metres; defaults to `sqrt(d^2 - (hs - hr)^2)`. |
| `humidity` | Deprecated alias of `relative_humidity` (remove in 4.0). |

**Returns:** [`OutdoorAttenuation`](/phonometry/reference/api/environment/outdoor-propagation/#outdoorattenuation) with the per-band term breakdown.

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | If `distance` is not positive. |

## OutdoorAttenuation

```python
OutdoorAttenuation(
    frequencies: NDArray[np.float64],
    a_div: NDArray[np.float64],
    a_atm: NDArray[np.float64],
    a_gr: NDArray[np.float64],
    a_bar: NDArray[np.float64],
    a_total: NDArray[np.float64],
    d_omega: NDArray[np.float64],
)
```

Per-octave-band ISO 9613-2 attenuation breakdown (clause 7).

Every array is aligned with `frequencies`. The terms sum, band by band,
to `a_total` (ISO 9613-2:1996, Eq. (4) without the informative
`Amisc`), so users can see the divergence, atmospheric, ground and barrier
contributions separately.

**Attributes**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `frequencies` | Nominal octave-band midband frequencies, in hertz. |
| `a_div` | Geometrical divergence `Adiv` (Eq. (7)), in dB, per band (identical across bands). |
| `a_atm` | Atmospheric absorption `Aatm` (Eq. (8)), in dB, per band. |
| `a_gr` | Ground effect `Agr` (Eq. (9) or (10)), in dB, per band. A negative value denotes a net gain from ground reflection. |
| `a_bar` | Screening `Abar` (Eq. (12)/(13)), in dB, per band (>= 0). |
| `a_total` | Total attenuation `A` (Eq. (4)), in dB, per band. |
| `d_omega` | Solid-angle directivity index `DOmega` (Eq. (11)), in dB; non-zero only for the alternative ground method of 7.3.2. |

Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.

### OutdoorAttenuation.plot()

```python
OutdoorAttenuation.plot(ax: Axes | None = None, **kwargs: Any) -> Axes
```

Plot the stacked per-band attenuation terms with the total.

Requires matplotlib (`pip install phonometry[plot]`); returns the
`Axes`.

## predicted_receiver_level

```python
predicted_receiver_level(
    sound_power_level: ArrayLike,
    distance: float,
    source_height: float,
    receiver_height: float,
    frequencies: ArrayLike = (63.0, 125.0, 250.0, 500.0, 1000.0, 2000.0, 4000.0, 8000.0),

    ground_receiver: float = 0.0,
    barrier: Barrier | None = None,
    temperature: float = 20.0,
    relative_humidity: float | None = None,
    pressure: float = 101.325,

    c0: float | None = None,
    projected_distance: float | None = None,
    *,
    humidity: float | str = 'deprecated',
) -> NDArray[np.float64]
```

Predicted octave-band receiver level (ISO 9613-2:1996, Eq. (3)/(6)).

Composes the downwind octave-band sound pressure level:

```text
LfT(DW) = Lw + Dc - A ,   Dc = directivity_index + DOmega
```

from the total attenuation [`outdoor_propagation_attenuation`](/phonometry/reference/api/environment/outdoor-propagation/#outdoor_propagation_attenuation). When `c0`
is given, the meteorological correction `Cmet` (Eq. (21)/(22)) is subtracted
band by band to approximate the long-term average level `LfT(LT)` (Eq. (6));
the standard applies `Cmet` to the A-weighted level, so this is a per-band
convenience.

| `projected_distance` | Ground-plane projected distance `dp`, in metres. |
| `humidity` | Deprecated alias of `relative_humidity` (remove in 4.0). |

**Returns:** Predicted octave-band level per frequency, in decibels.
