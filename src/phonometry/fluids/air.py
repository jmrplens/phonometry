"""Humid air (IEC 61094-2:2009, Annex F).

Annex F carries the CIPM-2007 formulation for the density of moist air together
with fits for the speed of sound, the ratio of specific heats, the viscosity and
the thermal diffusivity. It is the only model of air in this library that is
computed rather than quoted: every other air in the tree is a value some
standard printed for its own procedure, and those stay where their clause prints
them.

Table F.1 (printed folio 40) prints five quantities at two condition sets, and
every one of them reproduces here from the Table F.2 coefficients (printed folio
41) to better than 1,5e-7 relative, which is inside the rounding of the last
printed figure. Thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity come from the
two expressions of Clause F.6 (printed folio 39); the annex prints their formulae
and units but tabulates only the diffusivity they form, so those two are anchored
in closed form rather than against a printed number.
