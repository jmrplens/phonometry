"""The fiche staleness gate catches real drift and ignores encoding noise.

``scripts/check_reports.py`` is the gate that would have caught the two fiches
that sat a plot-styling release behind the library. It has to fail on the
changes that made them stale (a restyled fill, a moved plot line, a reworded
table) and pass on the sub-pixel wobble a different runner CPU produces, so
these tests drive both sides of every criterion with synthetic pages rather
than trusting the thresholds by inspection.
