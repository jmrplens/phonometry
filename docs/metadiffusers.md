# Metadiffusers

A Schroeder diffuser earns its diffusion with depth: the
[design equations](diffusers.md) turn a phase sequence into wells whose maximum
depth approaches half the design wavelength, so a diffuser for the low hundreds of hertz
is tens of centimetres thick, and that thickness is what keeps phase-grating
diffusers out of small rooms, studios and vehicles. A **metadiffuser**
(Jiménez, Cox, Romero-García and Groby, 2017) reaches the same reflection
phases from a panel one to two orders of magnitude thinner: each well becomes
a thin closed slit loaded by Helmholtz resonators, and the resonators slow the
sound inside the slit so drastically that a 2 cm panel behaves like wells
27 cm deep. This guide covers the slow-sound mechanism, the published
quadratic-residue metadiffuser evaluated end to end, and the design recipe
that maps any Schroeder sequence onto a deep-subwavelength panel.

## 1. Slow sound in a loaded slit

The unit cell is the same one the
[slow-sound absorber](metamaterial-absorbers.md) is built from: a slit of
height $h_n$ runs the depth $L$ of the panel and is loaded, along its upper
wall, by an array of Helmholtz resonators on a lattice step $a$. The slit
chain is evaluated with the transfer-matrix method,

$$
T = M_{\Delta l}\,\prod_m \left(M_s\,M_{HR}^{(m)}\,M_s\right),
$$

half-lattice slit steps $M_s$ around each resonator, the resonators as shunt
point scatterers $[[1,0],[1/Z_{HR},1]]$, and a slit-radiation end correction
$M_{\Delta l}$, with visco-thermal effective parameters in the slit and in the
square necks and cavities (Stinson 1991). Below the resonance of the loading
resonators the shunt compliance adds to the compliance of the slit itself, and
the effective phase velocity of the slit mode collapses: the retrieved
effective wavenumber $k_{eff}$ of the chain corresponds to a phase speed of a
few tens of metres per second. The slit therefore reaches its
quarter-wavelength condition, and any intermediate reflection phase, at a
fraction of the depth an air-filled well would need.

Two consequences make the mechanism ideal for diffusers rather than just
absorbers:

- **The reflection phase is tunable per slit.** The rigidly backed slit
  reflects with $R_n = (T_{11}\cos\theta - Z_0 T_{21})/(T_{11}\cos\theta +
  Z_0 T_{21})$, and the resonator geometry tunes the phase of $R_n$ through
  the full $2\pi$ range at the working frequency while $|R_n|$ stays close to
  one. A phase profile that a classical grating writes with depth, the
  metadiffuser writes with resonator tuning.
- **Critical coupling adds a third state.** Driving one slit to
  [critical coupling](metamaterial-absorbers.md) balances its visco-thermal
  loss against its leakage and produces a reflection zero: $R_n \approx 0$.
  Ternary sequences (reflection values $+1$, $-1$, $0$) need exactly that
  perfectly absorbing state, which no rigid well can provide.

`metadiffuser_reflection` runs that chain once per well (two-dimensional
resonators, visco-thermal losses and end corrections included) and returns the
per-well complex reflection $R_n(f)$; `metadiffuser_polar_response` and
`metadiffuser_diffusion_spectrum` reduce that spatial profile through the same
Fraunhofer far field and ISO 17497-2 coefficient used for the
[classical designs](diffusers.md). A `None` entry in the well sequence stands
for a flat rigid strip ($R = 1$), the $+1$ state of ternary designs.

## 2. The published quadratic-residue metadiffuser

The published design packs a whole $N = 5$ quadratic-residue diffuser into a
35 cm x 2 cm panel: five slits, each loaded by two resonators, on a 7 cm
pitch. Its first slit reaches critical coupling (the reflection zero the
ternary `0` state is built from), and at the 2 kHz evaluation frequency the
panel scatters like the 27.4 cm deep QRD it mimics.

## 3. The design recipe: phases first, geometry second

Designing a metadiffuser is a two-step translation. First pick the Schroeder
sequence exactly as for a [classical design](diffusers.md): the quadratic
residues $s_n = n^2 \bmod N$ give the target well depths
$d_n = s_n \lambda_0/(2N)$ and hence the target reflection phases
$\varphi_n = -2 k d_n$ at the evaluation frequency. Second, tune each slit
(its height, and the neck and cavity of its resonators) until the chain
reproduces that phase from the fixed panel depth $L$. The per-well reflection
returned by `metadiffuser_reflection` is the quantity to match; for the
published design at 2 kHz the five slits land within a few degrees of the QRD
targets while keeping $|R_n|$ near one:

```python
import numpy as np
from phonometry import materials, metadiffuser_reflection

# wells: the five published slits from the example above.
panel = metadiffuser_reflection(np.array([2000.0]), wells,
                                depth=0.02, period=0.07)
phases = np.degrees(np.angle(panel.reflection[:, 0]))
print(np.round(np.abs(panel.reflection[:, 0]), 2))  # [0.97 1.   1.   0.97 0.98]
print(np.round(phases))                             # [ 75. -71. -71.  74.   2.]

# The targets: the 500 Hz N = 5 QRD it mimics, evaluated at 2 kHz.
sequence = np.roll(materials.quadratic_residue_sequence(5), -1)
depths = sequence * (343.0 / 500.0) / (2 * 5)          # up to 27.4 cm deep
k = 2 * np.pi * 2000.0 / 343.0
targets = np.degrees(np.angle(np.exp(-2j * k * depths)))
print(np.round(targets))                            # [ 72. -72. -72.  72.   0.]
```

A 2 cm panel hitting the phases of 27.4 cm wells to within a few degrees is
the whole trick, and the limits of the trick are worth stating plainly:

- **Losses are not optional.** The same visco-thermal boundary layers that
  make critical coupling possible shave a few percent off $|R_n|$ everywhere,
  so a metadiffuser always absorbs a little where a rigid grating would not
  (the published designs stay in the percent range away from the
  critically coupled slit). The per-well and face-averaged absorption are
  exposed as `well_absorption` and `absorption` for exactly this check.
- **The phase match is dispersive.** A rigid well's phase grows linearly with
  frequency; a resonator-loaded slit's does not. The sequence is exact at the
  frequency it was tuned for and degrades away from it, so a broadband design
  is a compromise across the working band, checked with
  `metadiffuser_diffusion_spectrum` band by band rather than assumed from the
  design frequency alone.
- **Below resonance is the working side.** Above the resonance of the loading
  resonators the slow-sound branch closes and the slit stops tracking the
  target phase; designs place the resonances above the working band.

The reduction to a graded coefficient is then identical to the classical
workflow: `metadiffuser_polar_response` for one frequency,
`metadiffuser_diffusion_spectrum` for the band-by-band normalised coefficient,
both against the same-footprint flat reference of ISO 17497-2 Formula (7).

No standard governs the metadiffuser model itself; it is a journal method
(Jiménez et al. 2017) implemented clean-room from the cited sources. Its
output is graded by ISO 17497-2:2012 (diffusion coefficient), covered in
[Diffusers and Their Coefficients](diffusers.md), and its unit cell is the
slit and Helmholtz-resonator chain of
[Metamaterial Absorbers](metamaterial-absorbers.md). Numerical conformance
against the published designs and closed forms is tracked in
[CONFORMANCE.md](CONFORMANCE.md).
