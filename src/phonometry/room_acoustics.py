Room acoustic parameters from impulse responses per ISO 3382-1:2009
(performance spaces) and ISO 3382-2:2008 (ordinary rooms).

The measured impulse response (acquired e.g. with the swept-sine or MLS
front end of :mod:`phonometry.room_ir`, ISO 18233) is filtered into
fractional-octave bands (IEC 61260) and converted to a decay curve by
Schroeder backward integration of the squared impulse response
(ISO 3382-1:2009, 5.3.3, Equation (1)). To limit the influence of
background noise, the integration is truncated at the crossing point
between the background-noise level and a sloping line fitted to the
squared impulse response, and the missing tail is compensated assuming
an exponential decay with the fitted rate (5.3.3, Equation (3)).

From the decay curve the reverberation times are evaluated by
least-squares line fits (ISO 3382-2:2008, Clause 6 and Annex C):
EDT over 0 dB to -10 dB (ISO 3382-1:2009, A.2.2), T20 over -5 dB to
-25 dB and T30 over -5 dB to -35 dB, each extrapolated to a 60 dB decay
(T = -60/slope). The energy parameters follow ISO 3382-1:2009 Annex A:
clarity C50/C80 (Equation (A.10)), definition D50 (Equation (A.11)) and
centre time Ts (Equation (A.13)), with t = 0 at the start of the direct
sound (A.2.1).

Validity flags implement the dynamic-range criterion of ISO 3382-1:2009,
5.3.3: the background noise must lie at least the evaluation range plus
15 dB below the maximum of the (squared) impulse response - 25 dB for EDT
(equivalently, the noise floor sits at least 10 dB below the lowest
evaluation point). The +15 dB rule is derived for finite forward
integration without tail compensation (C = 0), which under-estimates T;
because this module compensates the truncated tail (5.3.3, Equation (3),
C != 0) with a residual positive bias, the T20 and T30 flags add extra
headroom (46 dB for T20, 54 dB for T30) so that a flagged-valid decay
time stays within the 5 % just-noticeable difference of ISO 3382-2:2008,
Table A.1. The curvature indicator C = 100*(T30/T20 - 1) follows
ISO 3382-2:2008, B.3; values above 10 % flag a decay curve that is far
from a straight line.

    :param fraction: Bandwidth fraction (1 = octave, 3 = one-third
        octave). Default 1.
    :param zero_phase: If True, use forward-backward (zero-phase) octave
        filtering, removing the filter group delay before the backward
        integration. ISO 3382-2:2008 Clause 7.3 NOTE permits time-reversed
        filtering (relaxing B*T > 16 to B*T > 4); it roughly halves the
        125 Hz short-decay T30 bias (about +4.9 % -> +2.4 % at T = 0.2 s).
        The benefit is small next to the ~10 % measurement variance but is
        free and standards-sanctioned. Default False (causal filtering).
    :return: :class:`RoomAcousticsResult` with one entry per band.
