"""Harmonic distortion of electroacoustic equipment (IEC 60268-3 / AES17).

Single-tone distortion metrics of amplifiers and audio equipment, from a
captured signal:

* **Total harmonic distortion** ``THD`` (IEC 60268-3 14.12.2-3), relative to
  the fundamental (``kind='F'``, the widespread convention) or to the total
  RMS (``kind='R'``, the 14.12.3.2 quantity), and the **nth-order harmonic
  distortion** (14.12.5).
* **THD+N** and the derived **SINAD** (AES17-2015 6.3.1): the fundamental is
  removed with the standard notch filter and the residual is compared with
  the total signal, both through the AES17 measurement bandwidth (20 Hz to
  20 kHz by default).
* **Weighted THD** (14.12.11), the harmonic residual weighted by the
  IEC 60268-1 / ITU-R BS.468-4 network (A/C optional), whose nominal
  response :func:`itu_r_468_weighting` exposes on its own.

All metrics have an exact analytic oracle: a signal synthesised with known
harmonic amplitudes reproduces the closed-form ratio. The functions assume
the tones fall on (or very near) FFT bins -- use coherent sampling (an
integer number of periods) or supply a low-leakage window, as audio
analysers do.

The two-tone metrics of IEC 60268-3 14.12.7-10 live in
:mod:`phonometry.electroacoustics.intermodulation`, and the AES17-2015 6.4
noise levels in :mod:`phonometry.electroacoustics.noise_measurements`; both
are built on the spectrum, notch and weighting helpers of this module.

    r"""ITU-R BS.468-4 weighting response, in dB re 1 kHz.

    Clause 1 of the Recommendation defines the nominal curve as the response
    of the passive network of Fig. 1a and prints Table 1 as "the values of
    this response at various frequencies", so the curve exists at every
    frequency and the 21 printed rows are that curve rounded to 0.1 dB. This
    is the closed-form evaluation of the same analog prototype the ``'468'``
    branch of :class:`~phonometry.filters.WeightingFilter` discretises,

    .. math::

       20 \lg \left| \frac{K\,s}{D(s)} \right|_{s = 2 \pi j f},

    with one zero at the origin, the six poles of the Fig. 1a ladder and
    :math:`K` set for 0 dB at the 1 kHz reference. The value is what a
    psophometric noise meter's weighting network would add to a tone at that
    frequency: about +12.22 dB at the 6.3 kHz peak, where broadcast-chain
    noise is most audible, and -22.2 dB at 20 kHz. Zero frequency (dc) maps
    to ``-inf`` dB, which is the series capacitor of Fig. 1a. AES17-2015
    5.2.7 tabulates the same curve with an additional gain of -5,63 dB
    (unity at 2 kHz, the "CCIR-RMS" filter). The comma is AES 17's own: the
    decimal separator here follows the document being quoted, and BS.468-4
    prints a point where AES 17 prints a comma.

    Reading the 21 rows and interpolating between them, which is what this
    function used to do, departs from the network by up to 0.611 dB at
    11 058 Hz, where the curve turns over fastest and the table samples it
    most coarsely. (The log-frequency interpolation rule of Table 1's
    footnote (1) governs the *tolerance* column, not the response, and runs
    between six mask frequencies rather than all 21.)
