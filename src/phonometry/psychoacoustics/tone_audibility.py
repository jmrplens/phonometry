Objective audibility of tones in noise -- engineering method (ISO/PAS 20065:2016).

ISO/PAS 20065 is the detailed engineering method that ISO 1996-2:2017 defers to
for the audibility of prominent tones; the simplified 2007/2009 Annex C method
lives in :mod:`phonometry.environmental_measurement`. The audibility of a tone
is the amount, in decibels, by which its tone level rises above the masking
threshold of the surrounding noise.

**Critical band about the tone (Clause 5.2).** The width of the critical band
around a tone of frequency ``fT`` is
``Δfc = 25.0 + 75.0·(1.0 + 1.4·(fT/1000)²)^0.69`` Hz (Formula (2)). Assuming a
geometric placement of the corner frequencies, ``fT = √(f1·f2)`` (Formula (3)),
``f1 = −Δfc/2 + √(Δfc² + 4·fT²)/2`` (Formula (4)) and ``f2 = f1 + Δfc``
(Formula (5)).

**Audibility of a single tone (Clause 5.3).** From the mean narrow-band level
``LS`` of the masking noise (Formula (6)) the critical-band level of the masking
noise is ``LG = LS + 10·lg(Δfc/Δf)`` (Formula (12), ``Δf`` the line spacing).
The masking index is ``av = −2 − lg[1 + (f/502)²·⁵]`` dB (Formula (13)) and the
audibility of a tone of level ``LT`` (Formula (8)) is
``ΔL = LT − LG − av`` dB (Formula (14)). A tone is present when ``ΔL > 0``.

**Decisive and mean audibility (Clauses 5.3.8/5.3.9).** The decisive audibility
of one narrow-band spectrum is the largest tone audibility in it (Step 4). Over
``J`` staggered spectra the mean audibility is the energy mean
``ΔL = 10·lg[(1/J)·Σ 10^(ΔLj/10)]`` dB (Formula (20)); a spectrum in which no
tone is found contributes ``ΔLj = −10 dB`` (Formula (21)).

**From a critical-band spectrum.** :func:`mean_narrowband_level` determines
``LS`` from the lines of the critical band by the iterative procedure of
Formula (6)/Annex D (energy average, dropping any line more than 6 dB above the
running mean, with the −1.76 dB Hanning bandwidth correction), and
:func:`tone_level` sums the tonal lines contiguous with the peak for ``LT``
(Formula (8)). Both reproduce the ISO/PAS 20065 Annex E worked example
(``LS = 49.22 dB``, ``LT = 67.96 dB`` for the 137.3 Hz tone) and are confirmed
against the parent standard DIN 45681:2005-03.

**Whole-spectrum detection.** :func:`analyze_spectrum` runs the full front-end
over a spectrum (mean narrow-band level per line, peak detection (Clause 5.3.8
Step 1), tone level, the distinctness test (Clause 5.3.4) and audibility) and
returns the distinct, audible tones. It then applies Step 3: tones sharing a
critical band have their tone levels energy-summed (Formula (17), via
:func:`combined_tone_level`, shared lines counted once) into an "FG" entry
rated at the most audible member, unless the exactly-two-tones-below-1000-Hz
exception (Formulae (18)/(19)) keeps them separate. On the Annex E example
this recovers the three tones, their combined tone level ``LT = 72.15 dB``
and the decisive FG audibility ``ΔL = 9.18 dB``. A decisive audibility
reproduced exactly needs the *complete* narrow-band spectrum: a spectrum
truncated to one critical band mis-estimates the mean narrow-band level of
tones near its edges.

**Two tones below 1000 Hz.** When *exactly two* tones share a critical band and
both lie below 1000 Hz, the ear can still resolve them if their spacing exceeds
``fD = 21·10^(1.2·|lg(fT/212)|^1.8)`` Hz (Formulae (18)/(19)); they are then
rated separately instead of combined. :func:`two_tone_separation_frequency` and
:func:`resolve_tones_separately` implement this branch (Clause 5.3.8), which no
ISO/PAS 20065 worked example exercises; it is verified against the DIN 45681
Annex J reference program rather than a numeric oracle.

**Uncertainty (Clauses 5.4/6).** :func:`audibility_uncertainty` propagates the
uniform 3 dB narrow-band level uncertainty through the audibility chain to the
extended uncertainty ``U`` (90 % bilateral coverage), and
:func:`mean_audibility_uncertainty` combines the per-spectrum values through
the Formula (20) mean. Clause 6: when fewer than 12 spectra have been
averaged, the extended uncertainty **shall** be taken into consideration.
:func:`analyze_spectrum` reports the per-tone ``U`` on its result.

**A-weighting.** Clause 5.3.2: unweighted narrow-band spectra "shall" be
A-weighted per IEC 61672-1 before the analysis. This module is
weighting-agnostic: pass A-weighted levels (the Annex E oracles are
A-weighted); it does not apply the weighting itself.

**Application frequency range.** The functions accept any positive tone
frequency, but the standards state narrower ranges: DIN 45681:2005-03 (5.3.2)
restricts the method to ``fT >= 90 Hz`` and the ISO/PAS 20065 scope starts at
50 Hz; the two-tone separation frequency (Formula (19)) is printed for
``fT < 1000 Hz`` (with a lower bound of 88 Hz in the DIN print, 50 Hz in the
ISO one). Results outside these ranges are extrapolations.

**Distinctness edge steepness (DIN-vs-ISO print difference).** The 5.3.4
edge-steepness test follows the DIN 45681 ``fT/sqrt(2)``-on-both-edges
reading, matching its executable Annex J reference program; the ISO/PAS
20065 print shows asymmetric formulas that contradict it (see
``_is_distinct`` and docs/ERRATA.md).
