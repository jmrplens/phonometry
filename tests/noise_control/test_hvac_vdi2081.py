"""Tests for the VDI 2081 fan model, against the guideline's own worked example.

Oracle: VDI 2081 Part 2:2005-05, *Air-conditioning: noise generation and noise
reduction. Examples*, Table 1 on printed folio 12, element 1 (the supply air
fan). Every expected value below is a cell of that printed table.

The method it exercises is VDI 2081 Part 1:2001-07, Section 4.3, printed folios
18 to 25: Equation (13) for the level, Equation (15) with Figures 10 to 12 for
the shape, Section 4.3.3 for the three assembly types and Figures 13 and 14 for
the allowance away from the best duty point.

Both prints are superseded, by VDI 2081 Part 1:2022-04 and Part 2:2022-10, and
neither successor is held. The pair in hand is self-consistent: Part 2:2005 was
written against Part 1:2001 and every cross-reference in its tables resolves
there, which is what makes the example usable as an oracle for this edition.
