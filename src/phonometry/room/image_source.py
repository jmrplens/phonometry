Synthetic room impulse response by the image-source method (rectangular room).

A rigid-walled (or absorbing) rectangular room -- a *shoebox* -- reflects a
point source in its six walls. Each reflection is equivalent to the free-field
sound of a mirror image of the source, so the room impulse response (RIR) is
the sum of the direct sound and one delayed, attenuated pulse per image
(Kuttruff, *Room Acoustics* 6th ed., 4.1, Equations (4.4)-(4.5); Vorlander,
*Auralization* 2nd ed., 11.4, the Allen-Berkley/Borish construction). This is
the deterministic complement of the statistical reverberation-time formulae of
:mod:`phonometry.room.reverberation_prediction`: where those give a single
decay rate, the image-source model gives the whole early reflection pattern and
the decay it implies.

**Image lattice.** For a room ``[0, Lx] x [0, Ly] x [0, Lz]`` with the source at
``(xs, ys, zs)``, mirroring a coordinate in a wall (Vorlander Equation (11.36),
``S_n = S - 2 d n``) turns the source into a regular lattice of images. Along
one axis the images sit at ``2 n L +- x`` for every integer ``n`` and the two
mirror parities; the parity index ``p`` and the lattice index ``n`` give the
number of reflections off the two walls of that axis as ``|n - p|`` (wall at 0)
and ``|n|`` (wall at ``L``), so the total reflection order of an image is
``|2 n_x - p_x| + |2 n_y - p_y| + |2 n_z - p_z|`` (Allen & Berkley, *J. Acoust.
Soc. Am.* 65 (1979) 943). The audible images up to order ``i0`` number
``(2/3)(2 i0^3 + 3 i0^2 + 4 i0)`` in a shoebox (Kuttruff Equation (9.23)); the
temporal density of reflections grows as ``dN/dt = 4 pi c^3 t^2 / V``
(Kuttruff Equation (4.6)).

**Per-image contribution.** Image ``i`` at distance ``r_i`` from the receiver
arrives at ``t_i = r_i / c`` (Vorlander Equation (11.38)) with amplitude

    A_i = [ product over walls of R_wall ^ (reflections there) ]
          * exp(-m r_i / 2) / (4 pi r_i),

the ``1 / (4 pi r_i)`` spherical spreading, the product of the wall
*pressure* reflection factors ``R = sqrt(1 - alpha)`` (Vorlander Equation
(11.39); ``|R|^2 = 1 - alpha`` in energy, Kuttruff 4.1) each raised to the
number of reflections that image made off that wall, and the air pressure
attenuation ``exp(-m r_i / 2)`` over the path (Kuttruff 4.1; ``m`` the
*intensity* attenuation constant, so intensity falls as ``exp(-m r)``). The RIR
is the sum of unit impulses at ``t_i`` weighted by ``A_i`` (Kuttruff Equation
(4.5), ``g(t) = sum_i A_i delta(t - t_i)``), assembled broadband from a single
absorption set or one curve per octave band from per-band coefficients.

The Schroeder backward integral of the synthetic RIR (see
:func:`phonometry.room.decay_curve`) reproduces the Eyring reverberation time
``T = -24 V ln 10 / (c S ln(1 - alpha_bar))`` (Kuttruff Equation (5.23)) of the
same room to within a few percent, closing the loop between this deterministic
model and the statistical prediction. The construction is exact only for walls
whose reflection factor is real and angle-independent (Kuttruff 4.1: exact for
a specific wall impedance of +-1, a good approximation when the source stands a
few wavelengths from every wall); it captures specular reflections only, with
no diffraction or diffuse scattering.
