Reverberation-time prediction from room geometry and absorption.

Predicts the reverberation time `T` of an enclosed space from its volume,
boundary areas and the sound-absorption coefficients of its surfaces, through
the classical statistical-acoustics formulae. Given a diffuse field and an
exponential energy decay, `T` is the time for the level to fall by 60 dB.

Five models are provided, in order of increasing account of a non-uniform
absorption distribution:

* **Sabine** -- the original diffuse-field estimate, `T = k V / (A + 4 m V)`
  with the total equivalent absorption area `A = sum_i S_i alpha_i` and the
  air term `4 m V`. Exact only for low, uniform absorption.
* **Eyring** (Norris-Eyring) -- replaces `A` by `-S ln(1 - alpha_bar)` with
  the mean absorption `alpha_bar = A / S` over the total surface `S`;
  correct in the strong-absorption limit where Sabine overestimates `T`.
* **Millington-Sette** -- `-sum_i S_i ln(1 - alpha_i)` sums the Eyring term
  per surface, so a single perfectly absorbing surface drives `T` to zero.
* **Fitzroy** -- an *area-weighted arithmetic* mean of three axial Eyring
  reverberation times, one per pair of opposing walls; captures rooms with the
  absorption concentrated on one axis (e.g. a carpeted, otherwise hard room).
* **Arau-Puchades** -- an *area-weighted geometric* mean of the same three axial
  Eyring times (Arau-Puchades, *Acustica* 65 (1988) 163): `T = prod_i T_i **
  (S_i / S)`. Recommended by its author over Fitzroy for anisotropic rooms.

The Sabine constant is `k = 24 ln 10 / c0` (`= 55.26 / c0`); with the
default `c0 = 343 m/s` it takes the familiar textbook value `0.161`. (The
[`enclosed_space_absorption`](/phonometry/reference/api/rooms/enclosed-space-absorption/) EN 12354-6 model instead rounds
`k` to `55.3` and uses `c0 = 345.6` to pin the factor at exactly `0.16`.)

Air absorption enters every model through the `air_attenuation` power
coefficient `m` (in neper per metre) as the additive term `4 m V`; obtain a
physical `m` from temperature and humidity with
[`phonometry.air_absorption.air_attenuation_m`](/phonometry/reference/api/environment/air-absorption/#air_attenuation_m).

Each model enforces its own mathematical domain on the absorption
coefficients. Sabine's linear sum is finite for any non-negative coefficient,
so it accepts measured ISO 354 values at or above 1 (up to a unit-error guard
at 2). The logarithmic models are stricter exactly where the maths requires
it: Millington-Sette needs *every* coefficient below 1, while Eyring, Fitzroy
and Arau-Puchades need each *mean* entering `ln(1 - alpha)` below 1.

The Fitzroy and Arau-Puchades models require a rectangular (shoebox) room and
take the room `dimensions` together with the mean absorption of each of the
three wall pairs. All five reduce to Eyring for a uniform absorption
distribution, and Eyring reduces to Sabine as the absorption tends to zero --
the identities the conformance suite anchors on, absent a machine-readable
worked example in the source texts.

## arau_puchades_reverberation_time

```python
arau_puchades_reverberation_time(
    dimensions: Sequence[float],
    absorptions: Sequence[ArrayLike],
    *,
    air_attenuation: ArrayLike = 0.0,
    speed_of_sound: float = 343.0,
) -> np.ndarray | float
```

Arau-Puchades reverberation time -- area-weighted geometric mean of axial times.

`T = prod_i T_i ** (S_i / S)` with `T_i` the Eyring time of the wall
pair perpendicular to axis `i` (Arau-Puchades, *Acustica* 65 (1988) 163,
Formula 18). Preferred by its author over Fitzroy for rooms with an
anisotropic absorption distribution. Reduces to Eyring for a uniform
distribution. Each input is itself a mean entering `ln(1 - alpha_i)`,
so each must be below 1.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `dimensions` | Room lengths `(Lx, Ly, Lz)`, m. |
| `absorptions` | Mean absorption `(alpha_x, alpha_y, alpha_z)` of the three wall pairs (perpendicular to x, y, z); each a scalar or per-band array. |
| `air_attenuation` | Air power-attenuation coefficient `m` (1/m). |
| `speed_of_sound` | Speed of sound `c0`, m/s. |

**Returns:** The reverberation time `T`, s.

## eyring_reverberation_time

```python
eyring_reverberation_time(
    volume: float,
    surfaces: Sequence[Surface],
    *,
    air_attenuation: ArrayLike = 0.0,
    speed_of_sound: float = 343.0,
) -> np.ndarray | float
```

Eyring (Norris-Eyring) reverberation time.

`T = k V / (-S ln(1 - alpha_bar) + 4 m V)` with the total surface `S`
and its area-weighted mean absorption `alpha_bar`.

The formula constrains only the *mean*: `ln(1 - alpha_bar)` requires
`alpha_bar < 1`, while individual coefficients at or above 1 (a measured
ISO 354 outcome) are accepted as long as the mean stays below 1 and each
coefficient stays within the shared unit-error ceiling of 2.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `volume` | Room volume `V`, m3. |
| `surfaces` | Sequence of `(area, absorption_coefficient)` pairs. |
| `air_attenuation` | Air power-attenuation coefficient `m` (1/m). |
| `speed_of_sound` | Speed of sound `c0`, m/s. |

**Returns:** The reverberation time `T`, s.

## fitzroy_reverberation_time

```python
fitzroy_reverberation_time(
    dimensions: Sequence[float],
    absorptions: Sequence[ArrayLike],
    *,
    air_attenuation: ArrayLike = 0.0,
    speed_of_sound: float = 343.0,
) -> np.ndarray | float
```

Fitzroy reverberation time -- area-weighted arithmetic mean of axial times.

`T = sum_i (S_i / S) T_i` with `T_i` the Eyring time of the wall pair
perpendicular to axis `i` (Fitzroy, *J. Acoust. Soc. Am.* 31 (1959) 893).
Equivalent to `T = k V / S**2 * sum_i S_i / (-ln(1 - alpha_i))` without
air. Reduces to Eyring for a uniform absorption distribution. Each input
is itself a mean entering `ln(1 - alpha_i)`, so each must be below 1.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `dimensions` | Room lengths `(Lx, Ly, Lz)`, m. |
| `absorptions` | Mean absorption `(alpha_x, alpha_y, alpha_z)` of the three wall pairs (perpendicular to x, y, z); each a scalar or per-band array. |
| `air_attenuation` | Air power-attenuation coefficient `m` (1/m). |
| `speed_of_sound` | Speed of sound `c0`, m/s. |

**Returns:** The reverberation time `T`, s.

## mean_absorption

```python
mean_absorption(surfaces: Sequence[Surface]) -> np.ndarray | float
```

Area-weighted mean absorption coefficient `alpha_bar = A / S`.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `surfaces` | Sequence of `(area, absorption_coefficient)` pairs; each coefficient a scalar or a per-band array. |

**Returns:** The mean absorption `sum_i S_i alpha_i / sum_i S_i`; a float for scalar coefficients, otherwise a per-band array.

## millington_sette_reverberation_time

```python
millington_sette_reverberation_time(
    volume: float,
    surfaces: Sequence[Surface],
    *,
    air_attenuation: ArrayLike = 0.0,
    speed_of_sound: float = 343.0,
) -> np.ndarray | float
```

Millington-Sette reverberation time.

`T = k V / (-sum_i S_i ln(1 - alpha_i) + 4 m V)`: the Eyring absorption
term summed surface by surface rather than through a single mean. A surface
approaching total absorption (`alpha_i -> 1`) drives `T` to zero.
Because the logarithm applies per surface, *every* coefficient must be
strictly below 1; measured ISO 354 coefficients at or above 1 are outside
this model's domain (use Sabine, or Eyring while the mean stays below 1).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `volume` | Room volume `V`, m3. |
| `surfaces` | Sequence of `(area, absorption_coefficient)` pairs. |
| `air_attenuation` | Air power-attenuation coefficient `m` (1/m). |
| `speed_of_sound` | Speed of sound `c0`, m/s. |

**Returns:** The reverberation time `T`, s.

## reverberation_time_models

```python
reverberation_time_models(
    dimensions: Sequence[float],
    absorptions: Sequence[ArrayLike],
    *,
    air_attenuation: ArrayLike = 0.0,
    frequencies: ArrayLike | None = None,
    speed_of_sound: float = 343.0,
) -> ReverberationModelResult
```

Predict the reverberation time of a rectangular room by all five models.

A convenience front-end that builds the six boundary surfaces of the room
from `dimensions` and the three wall-pair mean absorptions, then evaluates
[`sabine_reverberation_time`](/phonometry/reference/api/rooms/reverberation-prediction/#sabine_reverberation_time), [`eyring_reverberation_time`](/phonometry/reference/api/rooms/reverberation-prediction/#eyring_reverberation_time),
[`millington_sette_reverberation_time`](/phonometry/reference/api/rooms/reverberation-prediction/#millington_sette_reverberation_time), [`fitzroy_reverberation_time`](/phonometry/reference/api/rooms/reverberation-prediction/#fitzroy_reverberation_time)
and [`arau_puchades_reverberation_time`](/phonometry/reference/api/rooms/reverberation-prediction/#arau_puchades_reverberation_time) on a common footing. Because
the bundle evaluates the logarithmic models too, the inputs must satisfy
the strictest of the five domains: every absorption below 1.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `dimensions` | Room lengths `(Lx, Ly, Lz)`, m. |
| `absorptions` | Mean absorption `(alpha_x, alpha_y, alpha_z)` of the three wall pairs (perpendicular to x, y, z); each a scalar or a per-band array aligned with `frequencies`. |
| `air_attenuation` | Air power-attenuation coefficient `m` (1/m), scalar or per-band. |
| `frequencies` | Band centre frequencies, in hertz, used only to label the result and its plot; defaults to an integer index over the bands. |
| `speed_of_sound` | Speed of sound `c0`, m/s. |

**Returns:** The [`ReverberationModelResult`](/phonometry/reference/api/rooms/reverberation-prediction/#reverberationmodelresult).

```python
ReverberationModelResult.plot(ax: Axes | None = None, **kwargs: Any) -> Axes
```

Plot the reverberation-time curves of the five models.

`Axes`.

## sabine_reverberation_time

```python
sabine_reverberation_time(
    volume: float,
    surfaces: Sequence[Surface],
    *,
    air_attenuation: ArrayLike = 0.0,
    speed_of_sound: float = 343.0,
) -> np.ndarray | float
```

Sabine reverberation time `T = k V / (A + 4 m V)`.

`A = sum_i S_i alpha_i` is finite for any non-negative coefficient, so
unlike the logarithmic models Sabine accepts coefficients at or above 1:
measured ISO 354 reverberation-room values of 1.05 to 1.20 (the edge
effect) and the exact 1.0 that the ISO 11654 practical rating caps at are
legitimate inputs. Coefficients above 2 are rejected as a probable unit
error (a percentage passed instead of a fraction).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `volume` | Room volume `V`, m3. |
| `surfaces` | Sequence of `(area, absorption_coefficient)` pairs; each coefficient a scalar or a per-band array in `[0, 2]`. |
| `air_attenuation` | Air power-attenuation coefficient `m`, in neper per metre (scalar or per-band); see [`phonometry.air_absorption.air_attenuation_m`](/phonometry/reference/api/environment/air-absorption/#air_attenuation_m). Default `0` (air absorption neglected). |
| `speed_of_sound` | Speed of sound `c0`, m/s (default [`DEFAULT_SPEED_OF_SOUND`](/phonometry/reference/api/materials/road-absorption/#default_speed_of_sound), giving the factor `0.161`). |

**Returns:** The reverberation time `T`, s; a float for scalar inputs, otherwise a per-band array.
