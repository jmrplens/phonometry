"""Independent FDTD cross-check of a single 2D expansion chamber.

The four-pole expansion-chamber transmission loss (Bies Eq. (8.111)) predicts,
for an area ratio ``m = S_exp / S_duct``, a ``TL`` peak of
``10 log10[1 + (1/4)(m - 1/m)^2]`` at ``kL = pi/2`` (``f = c / 4L``) and a
``TL = 0`` trough (fully transparent) at ``kL = pi`` (``f = c / 2L``).

This test drives an *independent* solver -- the 2D FDTD engine of
:mod:`phonometry.simulation` -- with a plane-wave duct that widens into a
chamber and narrows back, and compares the transmitted amplitude at the peak
and trough frequencies. The measured ``20 log10`` ratio of the transmitted
amplitudes (trough over peak) must reproduce the closed-form peak ``TL``. The
run is deterministic and small (a 16x200 grid, ~3000 steps, well under a
second).
