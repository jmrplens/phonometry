Suspended-ceiling plenum flanking path (Vigran 9.2.3 after Mechel 1980;
ISO 140-9 / ISO 10848-2; ASTM E1414 / ASTM E413).

Two offices separated by a partition that stops at the suspended ceiling share
one continuous plenum above it. Sound leaves the source room through the
ceiling tiles, travels sideways over the partition and comes back down through
the tiles of the receiving room. That path is often the weakest link in an
open-plan fit-out, and it is *not* what a partition's `Rw` describes.

**The one-dimensional model (Vigran Eqs. (9.14) to (9.20)).** Mechel's
one-dimensional variant treats the plenum as a duct lined on one side. The
ceiling on each side has a transmission factor
$\tau_\mathrm{S} = \tau_\mathrm{S,pl} \, \tau_\mathrm{S,a}$ (plates times the prospective
plenum absorber, Eq. (9.14)); the power injected into the plenum splits, a
fraction $s_\mathrm{S}$ heading for the partition, and decays as
$\exp(-m x)$ with the power attenuation coefficient
$m = 2 \operatorname{Re}\{\Gamma\} = -2 \operatorname{Im}\{k'\}$
(Eqs. (9.15) and (9.16)). Integrating over the ceiling length on both sides
gives

$$
\tau_\mathrm{cl} = \frac{s_\mathrm{S} s_\mathrm{R} \tau_\mathrm{S} \tau_\mathrm{R} L_\mathrm{R}}{m_\mathrm{S} L_\mathrm{S} \, m'_\mathrm{R} L_\mathrm{R} \, h} \left( 1 - \exp(-\epsilon m_\mathrm{S} L_\mathrm{S}) \right) \left( 1 - \exp(-\epsilon m'_\mathrm{R} L_\mathrm{R}) \right) \tag{Eq. 9.18}
$$

with the receiving-side coefficient increased by the leakage back into the
room, $m'_\mathrm{R} = m_\mathrm{R} + s_\mathrm{R} \tau_\mathrm{R} / h$ (Eq. (9.17)). Vigran prints the
exponents with a factor 2 for totally reflecting plenum sidewalls and states
that totally absorbing ones give the same expression "without the factor 2",
so the factor is the same $\epsilon$ that the compact form carries.

.. warning::

   Vigran prints the **unprimed** $m_\mathrm{R}$ in that denominator. That is a
   misprint (see `docs/ERRATA.md`): the receiving-side integral
   $\int_0^{L_\mathrm{R}} \exp(-\epsilon m'_\mathrm{R} x) \, dx = (1 - \exp(-\epsilon m'_\mathrm{R} L_\mathrm{R}))/(\epsilon m'_\mathrm{R})$ carries $m'_\mathrm{R}$,
   exactly as the source-side one carries $m_\mathrm{S}$, and the printed
   reading leaves $\tau_\mathrm{cl}$ unbounded as $m_\mathrm{R} \to 0$, where the
   derived reading stays bounded by the leakage term. This module implements
   the derived $m'_\mathrm{R}$.

For a plenum with little attenuation on both sides ($m_\mathrm{S} L_\mathrm{S} \ll 1$
**and** $m'_\mathrm{R} L_\mathrm{R} \ll 1$, which needs a fairly insulating ceiling as
well as a weakly damped plenum, since $m'_\mathrm{R}$ never falls below
$s_\mathrm{R} \tau_\mathrm{R} / h$) and $s_\mathrm{S} = s_\mathrm{R} = 0.5$ it collapses to the
result that makes the geometry visible:

$$
\tau_\mathrm{cl} = \frac{\epsilon^2 \tau_\mathrm{S} \tau_\mathrm{R} L_\mathrm{R}}{4 h} \tag{Eq. 9.19}
$$

$$
R_\mathrm{cl} = R_\mathrm{S} + R_\mathrm{R} - 10 \log_{10}\!\left[ \frac{\epsilon^2 L_\mathrm{R}}{4 h} \right] \tag{Eq. 9.20}
$$

with $\epsilon = 1$ for totally absorbing plenum sidewalls and
$\epsilon = 2$ for totally reflecting ones. Referred to the partition
area instead of the ceiling, $R_\mathrm{cl,p} = R_\mathrm{cl} + 10 \log_{10}(H_\mathrm{S}/L_\mathrm{S})$
(Eq. (9.13)). A deep plenum helps (the $-10 \log_{10}$ term shrinks), a long
room hurts, and doubling the tile insulation helps twice over because
$R_\mathrm{S}$ and $R_\mathrm{R}$ both appear.

**The measured quantity (ISO 140-9:1985 clause 3.3, ISO 10848-2).** A ceiling
is not rated by $R_\mathrm{cl}$ but by the **normalized ceiling attenuation**
$D_\mathrm{n,c} = D - 10 \log_{10}(A/A_0)$, with `A` the receiving-room equivalent
absorption area and the reference $A_0 = 10$ m2. The laboratory has two
rooms of at least 50 m3 whose volumes differ by at least 10 %, a dividing
wall tapered to at most 100 mm at the top, and a plenum 650 mm to 760 mm deep
with one sidewall and both end walls lined; the standard prints the required
lining absorption $\alpha_\mathrm{s} \ge 0.65$ at 125 Hz and $\ge 0.80$
from 250 Hz to 4000 Hz, and requires $\alpha < 0.10$ on the other
sidewall and on the plenum ceiling. The North American counterpart,
ASTM E1414, uses $A_0 = 12$ m2, so an ASTM value runs about
$10 \log_{10}(12/10) = 0.79$ dB higher than the ISO one.

**Single number.** ISO rates $D_\mathrm{n,c}$ with the ISO 717-1 curve
([`phonometry.building.weighted_rating`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/ratings/#weighted_rating), giving `Dn,c,w`); ASTM E1414
rates it through ASTM E413 as the **ceiling attenuation class** (CAC). E413
rounds the data to the nearest integer (clause 5.2), shifts its reference
contour upward in 1 dB steps while the sum of the deficiencies stays at or
below 32 dB and no single deficiency exceeds 8 dB (clauses 5.3 and 5.4), and
reads the rating off the shifted contour at 500 Hz (clause 5.5). See
[`ceiling_attenuation_class`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/ceiling-plenum/#ceiling_attenuation_class).

:::note
The one-dimensional plenum model has **no published numeric output**: every
result in Vigran (Figs. 9.11 to 9.13) and in Mechel's *Formulas of Acoustics*
(Sections I.21 and I.22) is a figure. The functions here are anchored on the
closed forms, on the derivation of Eq. (9.18) from the two side integrals,
and on structural properties that a wrong reading breaks: the bound
$\tau_\mathrm{cl} \le 1$, a bare plenum no worse than the undamped
Eq. (9.20) value, and the small-attenuation limit taken where it applies
rather than only where the Eq. (9.17) leakage term happens to vanish.

    *,
    language: str = 'en',
    **kwargs: Any,
) -> Axes
```

Plot `Dn,c` against the fitted ASTM E413 contour.

`Axes`.

## normalized_ceiling_attenuation

```python
normalized_ceiling_attenuation(

    level_receiving: ArrayLike,
    absorption_area: ArrayLike,
    *,
    reference_area: float = 10.0,
) -> np.ndarray
```

Normalized ceiling attenuation `Dn,c` (ISO 140-9:1985, clause 3.3).

$D_\mathrm{n,c} = (L_1 - L_2) - 10 \log_{10}(A/A_0)$, the level difference
between two rooms sharing a common ceiling plenum, normalized to a
reference equivalent absorption area. ISO 140-9 and ISO 10848-2 use
$A_0 = 10$ m2; ASTM E1414 uses $A_0 = 12$ m2, which makes an
ASTM value about 0.79 dB higher for the same rooms.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `level_source` | Source-room sound pressure level `L1` per band, in dB. |

## plenum_flanking_reduction_index

```python
plenum_flanking_reduction_index(
    reduction_index_source: ArrayLike,
    reduction_index_receiving: ArrayLike,
    *,
    ceiling_length: float,
    plenum_height: float,
    sidewalls: str = ...,
    frequency: ArrayLike | None = ...,
    attenuation_source: ArrayLike,
    attenuation_receiving: ArrayLike,
    source_length: float | None = ...,
    split_source: float = ...,
    split_receiving: float = ...,
) -> PlenumFlankingResult

plenum_flanking_reduction_index(
    reduction_index_source: ArrayLike,
    reduction_index_receiving: ArrayLike,
    *,
    ceiling_length: float,
    plenum_height: float,
    sidewalls: str = ...,
    frequency: ArrayLike | None = ...,
    source_length: float | None = ...,
    split_source: float = ...,
    split_receiving: float = ...,
) -> PlenumFlankingResult
```

Ceiling/plenum flanking reduction index `Rcl` (Vigran
Eqs. (9.18)-(9.20)).

With no attenuation coefficients this is the compact undamped form
$R_\mathrm{cl} = R_\mathrm{S} + R_\mathrm{R} - 10 \log_{10}[\epsilon^2 L_\mathrm{R}/(4h)]$ (Eq. (9.20)).
Supplying the plenum power attenuation coefficients $m_\mathrm{S}$ and
$m_\mathrm{R}$ (Eq. (9.16), $m = -2 \operatorname{Im}\{k'\}$ of the
lined duct) switches to the full Eq. (9.18), whose receiving side carries
the leakage term $m'_\mathrm{R} = m_\mathrm{R} + s_\mathrm{R} \tau_\mathrm{R}/h$ (Eq. (9.17)) in both
the exponent and the denominator. Vigran prints the denominator with the
unprimed $m_\mathrm{R}$; that is a misprint and the derived reading is
implemented here (see `docs/ERRATA.md`).

Because $m'_\mathrm{R}$ never falls below $s_\mathrm{R} \tau_\mathrm{R} / h$, the
attenuated form approaches Eq. (9.20) only when the ceiling is insulating
enough for $m'_\mathrm{R} L_\mathrm{R}$ to be small as well; at $R = 20$ dB
with the geometry of Vigran's own example the leakage term is still worth
about 0.24 dB.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `reduction_index_source` | Source-side ceiling `RS` per band, in dB (the ceiling plates and any plenum absorber together, Eq. (9.14)). |

| `attenuation_source` | Optional plenum power attenuation coefficient `mS` per band, in 1/m (> 0); switches to Eq. (9.18). |
| `attenuation_receiving` | Optional `mR` per band, in 1/m (> 0); required together with *attenuation_source*. |
| `source_length` | Source-side ceiling length `LS`, in m (Default: equal to *ceiling_length*). |
