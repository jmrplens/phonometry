// Where every address this site has ever published now lives.
//
// The site has been reorganised repeatedly: guides were split into focused
// pages, then filed into topic folders, then given subgroups. Each of those
// moves changed the URL of every page it touched, and a moved page leaves its
// old address behind as a 404 unless something is done about it. Almost
// nothing was: `astro.config.mjs` carried eight redirect entries against 432
// addresses that had gone dead, so `/guides/room-acoustics/`,
// `/guides/sound-power/`, `/reference/why-phonometry/` and hundreds more
// answered 404 to anyone arriving from a search result, a bookmark or a
// citation. This project runs IndexNow and asks to be cited, so those are the
// arrivals that matter most.
//
// This module derives the answer instead of asking anyone to remember it. It
// replays the rename history of `site/src/content/docs/` commit by commit,
// carrying every page's identity across each move, so a page that has been
// renamed four times still knows all four of its former addresses. The map it
// produces is written to `src/data/redirects.mjs` by `generate-redirects.mjs`
// and checked against history again by `check-redirects.mjs`, so the next move
// cannot land without its redirects.
//
// Two things the replay cannot know are stated by hand below: the deployment
// cutoff, and where the content of a page that was split or deleted went.
