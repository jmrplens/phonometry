# Occupational Noise Exposure (ISO 9612)

A working day is rarely measured in one take: the daily exposure level a
regulation acts on has to be assembled from *samples* of a real shift, and
reported with an uncertainty a hygienist can defend. `lex_8h` (in
[Levels](levels.md)) turns *one* recording into a daily level. ISO 9612:2009,
the engineering method (accuracy grade 2), is the survey design *around* that
primitive: how to sample a real working day, how to combine the pieces, and how
to attach the normative uncertainty every occupational-hygiene report needs. The
`occupational_exposure` module adds the three **measurement strategies** and the
**Annex C** uncertainty budget on top of the energy-average machinery.

Right: the three measurement strategies drawn as timelines over an eight-hour working day, task-based (the day split into labelled tasks, at least three samples plus a duration each), job-based (five or more random samples spread over the homogeneous exposure group) and full-day (the whole shift measured at least three times), all feeding the LEX,8h and its Annex C uncertainty, chosen by work pattern from Table B.1" width="94%"></picture>

## 1. The three measurement strategies (Clauses 9-11)

The *task-based* strategy (Clause 9) splits the nominal day into tasks, takes
$I \ge 3$ samples per task, and energy-sums the task contributions

$$
L_{EX,8h,m} = L_{p,A,eqT,m} + 10 \log_{10}(T_m/T_0), \qquad T_0 = 8\ \text{h},
$$

so a loud but short task contributes little. The *job-based* (Clause 10) and
*full-day* (Clause 11) strategies instead take $N \ge 5$ (or three whole-day)
random samples over a homogeneous exposure group and normalise the effective-day
duration. The daily level is the same either way; the strategies differ in how
the **uncertainty** is built.

**Choosing a strategy.** ISO 9612 Table B.1 picks the strategy from the *work
pattern*, not from convenience, and the trade-off is coverage against effort.
The **task-based** strategy is the recommended default when the day
decomposes into a small number of well-defined tasks: because it measures each
task separately, it explains *where* the dose comes from (the per-task
breakdown above) and lets a short, loud task be sampled properly without
dragging out the whole survey, but it needs a reliable work analysis, and its
uncertainty grows if the task durations are themselves uncertain. The
**job-based** strategy suits a mobile worker with an unpredictable pattern or
a homogeneous group doing "the same job": random samples across the group
average over the variability instead of resolving it, which is robust when the
day cannot be cleanly cut into tasks but blind to which activity dominates.
The **full-day** strategy (a worn dosimeter capturing the entire shift,
repeated on several days) needs the least analysis and captures everything
including the unexpected, at the cost of the most wearer-days and the weakest
diagnostic value (one number per day, no breakdown, and false contributions
like knocks on the microphone are hard to spot). As a rule: resolve the dose
with task-based when you can, fall back to job-based for irregular work, and
use full-day when the pattern defies description or an independent whole-shift
check is wanted.

## 2. The Annex C uncertainty budget

Two subtleties are worth spelling out. First, the coverage factor is
$k = 1.65$ for a **one-sided** 95 % interval (Clause 14), because a hygienist
cares only about the *upper* bound: `res.upper_limit` = $L_{EX,8h} + U$ is the
value 95 % of measurements fall below, the number compared against an action
limit. Second, the task and job methods weight the *same* spread of samples
differently. The task sampling uncertainty $u_{1a}$ (Eq. C.6) divides the summed
squared deviations by $I(I-1)$ (the standard error of the mean, smaller by a
factor $\sqrt{I}$), whereas the job/full-day sampling uncertainty $u_1$ (Eq. C.12)
is the plain sample standard deviation with denominator $N-1$, whose contribution
$c_1 u_1$ is then read from **Table C.4** as a function of $(N, u_1)$. The same
raw scatter therefore inflates the job estimate more, which is the standard's
built-in penalty for coarser, fewer samples. (The printed job $L_{EX,8h}$ is
$88.2$ dB where Annex E reports $88.1$: the standard rounds the effective-day
level to $88.4$ before the duration normalisation; the library keeps it
unrounded.)

**What dominates the budget.** Annex C combines four sources in quadrature
(Table C.1): the **sampling** uncertainty ($u_{1a}$/$u_1$), the **duration**
uncertainty ($u_{1b}$, task-based only), the **instrument** ($u_2$, Table C.5)
and the **microphone position** ($u_3$, Clause C.6). The last two are small
and roughly fixed ($u_2 = 0.7$ dB for a class 1 sound level meter, 1.5 dB for
a class 2 meter or a personal exposimeter, and $u_3 = 1.0$ dB by default), so
in practice the **sampling term almost always dominates**: it scales with the
scatter of the measured levels, which in a real workplace easily reaches
several decibels and, entered in quadrature, swamps the sub-decibel
instrument and position terms. The practical consequence: a quadrature
budget is set by its largest term, so tightening the instrument grade buys
little once sampling scatter is large; the productive
move is *more samples* (the standard error falls as $1/\sqrt{I}$ or $1/\sqrt{N}$),
which is exactly what the Clause 9.3 / 10.4 advisories nudge you toward.
Because peak $L_{p,Cpeak}$ carries no Annex C sampling model (Table C.5,
Note 1), it is reported without an uncertainty, not with a zero one.

When a task's samples span **3 dB or more** (Clause 9.3), or the job contribution
$c_1 u_1$ exceeds 3.5 dB (Clause 10.4), or too few workers are covered
(Table 1 cumulative-duration), the result sets `sampling_advisory=True` and, with
`warn=True`, emits an `OccupationalExposureWarning` recommending more measurements. Peak
levels $L_{p,Cpeak}$ are reported **without** an uncertainty: Annex C gives no
method for them (Table C.5, Note 1), so peak-uncertainty is out of scope. The
three Annex D/E/F worked examples above are reproduced to the standard's printed
precision (Annex E's final rounding is disclosed above), and the theory is
derived on the [Theory](theory-environment-transport.md) page.

### `task_based_exposure()` / `job_based_exposure()` / `full_day_exposure()` parameters

| Parameter | Applies to | Type | Units | Range / default | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `tasks` | task | list of `Task` | — | ≥ 1 | Each `Task` has `samples`, `duration_hours`, optional `duration_range`/`duration_samples`, `label`, `instrument` |
| `samples` | job / full-day | sequence | dB | ≥ 2 (≥ 5 / ≥ 3 advised) | Random `Lp,A,eqT` samples |
| `effective_duration_hours` | job / full-day | float | h | > 0 | Effective working-day duration $T_e$ |
| `instrument` | all | str | — | `'class1'`, `'class2'`, `'personal_exposimeter'` (default) | Selects $u_2$ (Table C.5) |
| `u3` | all | float | dB | default `1.0` | Microphone-position uncertainty (Clause C.6) |
| `include_duration_uncertainty` | task | bool | — | default `True` | `False` omits the $(c_{1b}u_{1b})^2$ term (Annex D case a) |
| `n_workers` / `sample_duration_hours` | job | int / float | — / h | default `None` | Table 1 cumulative-duration check |
| `warn` | all | bool | — | default `True` | Emit `OccupationalExposureWarning` for the sampling advisories |

All three return an `ExposureResult` with `lex_8h`, `combined_standard_uncertainty`
$u$, `expanded_uncertainty` $U = 1.65\ u$, `upper_limit` = $L_{EX,8h} + U$,
`sampling_advisory`, and (task-based) the per-task `tasks` breakdown; the
result's `.plot()` draws the per-task contribution bars with the $L_{EX,8h}$
and upper-limit lines (task-based results only, since the other strategies
carry no per-task breakdown).
