Heavy and soft impact sources: rubber ball and bang machine
(ISO 16283-2:2020 Annex A, ISO 10140-5:2010 Annex F, JIS A 1418-2:2019,
ISO 717-2:2020 Annex D).

The ISO tapping machine is a *light* impact source: five 500 g hammers dropped
from 40 mm produce a short, hard, quasi-stationary excitation whose spectrum
peaks well above 100 Hz. Real heavy impacts in a dwelling, a child jumping off
a chair or an adult walking barefoot, are slow, soft and low-frequency, and the
tapping machine says almost nothing about them. The **standard heavy impact
sources** were introduced for exactly that: a hollow silicone **rubber ball**
dropped from 1 m, and the **bang machine**, a car tyre dropped from 85 cm. Both
excite the floor with a single-peak force pulse about 20 ms long that puts most
of its energy below 125 Hz, and both are rated by a **maximum** (Fast
time-weighted) sound pressure level rather than by an energy average.

**Impact force exposure level (ISO 16283-2 Formula (A.1) = JIS A 1418-2
Formula (1)).** A heavy source is specified not by its geometry but by the
octave-band energy of its force pulse::

    LFE = 10 lg[ (1/Tref) integral_t1^t2 F(t)**2 / F0**2 dt ]   dB re 1 N

with ``F0 = 1 N``, ``Tref = 1 s`` and ``t2 - t1`` the duration of the impact
force. The specification is stated **per octave band**, so the force record is
band-filtered before the integral (JIS A 1418-2:2019 Annex C puts the filter
between the force transducer and the analyser).
:func:`impact_force_exposure_level` evaluates the integral over whatever record
it is given, i.e. one band at a time;
:func:`heavy_impact_source_limits` returns the printed octave-band tolerance
table and :func:`check_heavy_impact_source` verifies the five band results
against it.

The two source specifications are printed identically in ISO 16283-2:2020
Table A.1 and ISO 10140-5:2010 Table F.1 (rubber ball), and in
JIS A 1418-2:2019 Tables A.2 (rubber ball, *impact force characteristic 2*) and
A.1 (bang machine, *impact force characteristic 1*):

**Standardized maximum impact sound pressure level (ISO 16283-2 Formulae (4),
(5) and (6)).** Because the rated quantity is a *maximum* of a Fast-weighted
level and not an energy average, the receiving room cannot be corrected with
the usual ``10 lg(T/T0)``: the Fast detector only ever sees the first
``1,7275 s`` worth of decay. The standard therefore uses::

    L'i,Fmax,V,T = Li,Fmax + 10 lg(V/V0) - 10 lg[ g(C) / g(C0) ]
    C0 = T0 / 1,7275                                            (5)
    C  = T  / 1,7275                                            (6)

with ``T0 = 0,5 s``, ``V0 = 50 m3`` and, writing Formula (4) in the compact
form used here,

    ``g(C) = (C**(1/(1-C)) - C**(-1/(1-1/C))) / (1 - 1/C)``.

``g`` is the peak of the Fast-weighted response to an exponentially decaying
burst; for ``T = T0`` the bracket collapses to 1 and the correction reduces to
the pure volume term ``10 lg(V/V0)``, as it must. See
:func:`standardized_maximum_impact_level` and
:func:`fast_reverberation_correction`.

**A-weighted rating (ISO 717-2:2020 Annex D, normative).** The single number is
not a shifted reference curve but an A-weighted sum (Formula (D.1))::

    XiA,Fmax = 10 lg( sum_j 10**((Xi,Fmax,j + Aj)/10) )

over the one-third-octave bands 50 Hz to 630 Hz **or** the octave bands 63 Hz to
500 Hz, with the Table D.3 A-weighting corrections, rounded half-up to an
integer. One-third-octave measurements are rated in one-third octaves, never by
first summing them into octaves. See
:func:`a_weighted_maximum_impact_level`; :func:`heavy_impact_octave_levels`
implements the separate octave-band conversion of ISO 16283-2 Formula (20),
used when the *measurement* is reported in octaves.
