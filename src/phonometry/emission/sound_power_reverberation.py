r"""Sound power level of a noise source measured in a reverberation test room:
ISO 3741:2010 (precision method, accuracy grade 1).

The source is placed in a hard-walled reverberation room whose reverberant
field is sampled by microphones. Two methods are provided.

The **direct method** derives the sound power from the mean corrected room
sound pressure level ``Lp(ST)`` and the equivalent absorption area ``A`` of the
room, with the Sabine absorption area and the speed of sound ``c`` in m/s
(ISO 3741:2010 clause 9.1.4, Eq. 20):

.. math::

   L_p(\text{ST}) = 10 \log_{10}\!\left[ \frac{1}{N_\mathrm{M}} \sum_i 10^{0.1 L_{pi}}
   \right] \tag{Eq. 16}

   A = \frac{55.26}{c} \, \frac{V}{T_{60}}

   c = 20.05 \sqrt{273 + \theta}

   L_W = L_p(\text{ST}) + 10 \log_{10}\frac{A}{A_0} + 4.34 \frac{A}{S}
   + 10 \log_{10}\!\left( 1 + \frac{S c}{8 V f} \right) + C_1 + C_2 - 6
   \tag{Eq. 20}

:math:`10 \log_{10}(1 + Sc/(8Vf))` is the Waterhouse boundary correction (energy
stored near the room boundaries); it vanishes as the frequency grows. ``C1``
(Eq. 20, reference-quantity correction) and ``C2`` (radiation-impedance
correction) carry the result to the reference meteorological conditions of
clause 4 (23.0 C, 101.325 kPa, 50 %), per clause 9.1.4:

.. math::

   C_1 = -10 \log_{10}\frac{p_\mathrm{s}}{p_{\mathrm{s}0}} + 5 \log_{10}\frac{273.15 + \theta}{314}

   C_2 = -10 \log_{10}\frac{p_\mathrm{s}}{p_{\mathrm{s}0}} + 15 \log_{10}\frac{273.15 + \theta}{296}

The **comparison method** replaces the absorption-area terms by a reference
sound source (RSS) of known sound power ``LW(RSS)`` measured at the same
positions (ISO 3741:2010 clause 9.1.5, Eq. 21):

.. math::

   L_W = L_W(\text{RSS}) + \left( L_p(\text{ST}) - L_p(\text{RSS}) + C_2
   \right) \tag{Eq. 21}

Both methods cover the one-third-octave bands from 100 Hz to 10 kHz (clause
8.1). Octave-band, A-weighted and total levels follow ISO 3741 Annex F, which
reuses the ISO 3744 Annex E A-weighting band corrections.

A noise burst or a transient emission is described by the **sound energy
level** :math:`L_J = 10 \log_{10}(J/J_0)`, :math:`J_0 = 1` pJ (clause 3.18),
and clause 9.2 determines it by the same two methods with the single event
time-integrated sound pressure level :math:`L_E` (clause 3.4) in place of the
time-averaged :math:`L_p`: the :math:`N_\mathrm{e}` events at each position
are reduced to the level of one event (Eq. 22 or Eq. 23), each position is
corrected for its background by :math:`K_{1i}` (Eq. 25, 26) as in 9.1.2, the
positions are energy-averaged (Eq. 27), and the room enters through the same
bracket as Eq. (20) or the same reference source as Eq. (21):

.. math::

   L_J = \overline{L_E(\text{ST})} + \left[ 10 \log_{10}\frac{A}{A_0}
   + 4.34 \frac{A}{S} + 10 \log_{10}\!\left( 1 + \frac{S c}{8 V f} \right)
   + C_1 + C_2 - 6 \right] \tag{Eq. 30}

   L_J = L_W(\text{RSS}) + \left( \overline{L_E(\text{ST})}
   - \overline{L_p(\text{RSS})} \right) + C_2 \tag{Eq. 31}

For a source steady over the whole interval :math:`T`, clause 3.4 NOTE 1
gives :math:`L_E = L_{p,T} + 10 \log_{10}(T/T_0)`, :math:`T_0 = 1` s, and
so :math:`L_J = L_W + 10 \log_{10}(T/T_0)`. Annex F sums the one-third-octave
levels into octave bands (Eq. F.1, F.4) and A-weights them (Eq. F.2, F.5)
alike for the two quantities.

    ``sound_power_level`` is the per-band ``LW`` (Eq. 20 direct method, Eq. 21
    comparison method). ``mean_pressure_level`` is the mean corrected room level
    ``Lp(ST)`` (Eq. 16). For the direct method ``absorption_area`` is the Sabine
    equivalent absorption area ``A`` per band and ``waterhouse_correction`` the
    boundary term :math:`10 \log_{10}(1 + Sc/(8Vf))`; both are ``NaN`` for the
    comparison method. ``background_correction`` is the effective per-band
    background correction ``K1``: with per-position input each position is
    corrected by its own ``K1i`` (Eq. 14/15) before the energy average
    (Eq. 16), and the reported value is the resulting per-band shift of the
    mean level (zero when no background is supplied).
    ``c1`` and ``c2`` are the reference-quantity and radiation-impedance
    corrections (``c1`` is ``NaN`` for the comparison method, which uses only
    ``c2``). ``speed_of_sound`` is ``c`` at the test temperature.
    ``sound_power_level_a`` is the A-weighted total ``LWA`` (Annex F Eq. F.2),
    computed only when ``frequencies`` are supplied (``NaN`` for several bands
    without them; equal to ``LW`` for a single band). ``method`` is ``'direct'``
    or ``'comparison'``.
