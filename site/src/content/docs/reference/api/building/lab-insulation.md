Laboratory sound insulation of building elements (ISO 10140).

This is the **laboratory** counterpart of the field ISO 16283 family in
[`phonometry.insulation`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/). In a qualified test facility flanking
transmission is suppressed, so the *direct* airborne sound reduction index
`R` (not the apparent `R'`) is the primary quantity, and the receiving
room's equivalent absorption area `A` is a property of the known facility.

**Airborne sound reduction index (ISO 10140-2:2010).** From the
energy-average sound pressure levels in the source room `L1` and receiving
room `L2` this module forms, per one-third-octave band,
`R = L1 - L2 + 10 lg(S/A)` (Clause 3.1, Formula (2)) with the free test
opening area `S` and the Sabine equivalent absorption area
`A = 0,16 V / T` (ISO 10140-4:2010, Clause 4.6.3, Formula (5)). The
single-number weighted rating `Rw` and the adaptation terms `C` / `Ctr`
follow ISO 717-1 (Clause 5.3) through the verified
[`phonometry.weighted_rating`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#weighted_rating) engine, reused unchanged.

**Impact sound pressure level (ISO 10140-3:2010).** With the standard
tapping machine exciting the floor under test this module forms, from the
energy-average impact sound pressure level `Li` in the receiving room, the
normalized impact sound pressure level `Ln = Li + 10 lg(A/A0)` (Clause 3.2,
Formula (1)) with `A = 0,16 V / T` and the reference absorption area
`A0 = 10 m²`. The single-number weighted rating `Ln,w` and the term
`CI` follow ISO 717-2 (Clause 5.3) through
[`phonometry.weighted_impact_rating`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#weighted_impact_rating), reused unchanged.

**Background-noise correction (ISO 10140-4:2010, Clause 4.3, Formula (4)).**
The receiving-room levels must be corrected for background noise before the
insulation is formed. [`background_correction`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/lab-insulation/#background_correction) implements the correction
`L = 10 lg(10^(Lsb/10) - 10^(Lb/10))` for a signal-to-background margin
between 6 dB and 15 dB, the fixed 1,3 dB correction (limit of measurement)
for a margin of 6 dB or less, and no correction for a margin of 15 dB or
more. The 6/15 dB criteria are the laboratory analogue of the 6/10 dB
criteria of ISO 16283-1 Clause 9.2; both cap the correction at 1,3 dB.

**Frequency range (ISO 10140-4:2010, Clause 4.1).** Quantities are measured
over the mandatory one-third-octave range 100 Hz to 5000 Hz (optionally down
to 50 Hz). The single-number rating uses the core 100 Hz to 3150 Hz (16
one-third-octave bands) / 125 Hz to 2000 Hz (5 octave bands) range of
ISO 717-1/2, so the automatic rating is formed only when exactly 16 or 5
per-band values are supplied.

## background_correction

```python
background_correction(
    signal_and_background: Sequence[float] | np.ndarray,
    background: Sequence[float] | np.ndarray,
) -> np.ndarray
```

Correct receiving-room levels for background noise (ISO 10140-4:2010).

Applies the correction of Clause 4.3 per band from the combined
signal-plus-background level `Lsb` and the background level `Lb`,
using the margin `Lsb - Lb`:

- `margin >= 15 dB`: the background is negligible and the level is
  returned unchanged (Clause 4.3, quality requirement).
- `6 dB < margin < 15 dB`: the level is corrected with Formula (4),
  `L = 10 lg(10^(Lsb/10) - 10^(Lb/10))`.
- `margin <= 6 dB`: the fixed 1,3 dB correction is applied
  (`L = Lsb - 1,3`); such bands are the *limit of measurement* and a
  [`LabInsulationWarning`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/lab-insulation/#labinsulationwarning) is emitted (Clause 4.3). A *negative*
  margin (`Lb > Lsb`, i.e. background above the measured signal) falls
  in this branch and is likewise capped at `Lsb - 1,3`: the band is
  simply flagged as the limit of measurement rather than yielding a
  nonsensical (or `NaN`) corrected level.

This is the sound-insulation counterpart of
[`phonometry.background_noise_correction`](/phonometry/reference/api/power/sound-power/#background_noise_correction) (ISO 3744:2010): both apply
the same energy subtraction `10 lg(10^(Lsb/10) - 10^(Lb/10))`, but that
routine returns the correction *offset* `K1` (to subtract from `Lsb`),
whereas this one returns the already-corrected levels `L` directly.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `signal_and_background` | Combined signal-plus-background levels `Lsb` per band, in dB. |
| `background` | Background-noise levels `Lb` per band, in dB. |

**Returns:** The background-corrected levels per band, in dB.

**Raises**

## lab_airborne_insulation

```python
lab_airborne_insulation(
    l1: Sequence[float] | np.ndarray,
    l2: Sequence[float] | np.ndarray,
    t2: Sequence[float] | np.ndarray,
    *,
    area: float,
    volume: float,
) -> LabAirborneInsulationResult
```

Laboratory airborne sound reduction index per ISO 10140-2:2010.

Computes, per frequency band, the sound reduction index
`R = L1 - L2 + 10 lg(S/A)` (Clause 3.1, Formula (2)) with the free test
opening area `S` and the Sabine equivalent absorption area
`A = 0,16 V / T` (ISO 10140-4:2010, Formula (5)). When exactly 16
one-third-octave (100-3150 Hz) or 5 octave (125-2000 Hz) values are
supplied, the single-number weighted rating `Rw` with `C` / `Ctr`
is also formed via [`phonometry.weighted_rating`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#weighted_rating) (ISO 717-1).

`l1` and `l2` may be one value per band (already energy-averaged) or a
two-dimensional `(positions, bands)` array, in which case the positions
are energy-averaged (ISO 10140-4:2010, Formula (2)). The band levels are
assumed already corrected for background noise (see
[`background_correction`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/lab-insulation/#background_correction)).

**Parameters**

| :--- | :--- |
| `l1` | Source-room sound pressure levels, in dB. |

| `t2` | Receiving-room reverberation time per band, in seconds. |

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | If the band counts of `l1`, `l2` and `t2` differ, if `area`/`volume`/`t2` are not positive, or if inputs are non-finite. |

```

Laboratory impact sound pressure level per ISO 10140-3:2010.

equivalent absorption area `A = 0,16 V / T` (ISO 10140-4:2010,
Formula (5)) and the reference absorption area `A0 = 10 m²`. When exactly
16 one-third-octave (100-3150 Hz) or 5 octave (125-2000 Hz) values are
supplied, the single-number weighted rating `Ln,w` with `CI` is also
formed via [`phonometry.weighted_impact_rating`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#weighted_impact_rating) (ISO 717-2).

`li` may be one value per band (already energy-averaged) or a
two-dimensional `(positions, bands)` array, in which case the positions
