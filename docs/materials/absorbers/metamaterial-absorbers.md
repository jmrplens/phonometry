# Metamaterial Absorbers

A porous blanket absorbs low frequencies only by growing thick: the
[porous models](porous-absorbers.md) put the useful absorption where the layer
is a fair fraction of the wavelength, which at 300 Hz means tens of
centimetres. Acoustic metamaterial absorbers break that rule with resonance
instead of bulk. A rigid panel of thin closed slits, each loaded by Helmholtz
resonators, slows the sound inside the slit until a 3 cm panel resonates where
a plain cavity of the same depth would need to be ten times deeper, and tuning
the panel's internal losses against its leakage produces **perfect
absorption**, $\alpha = 1$, at a design frequency where the panel is only
$\lambda/38$ deep; published designs of the same family reach $\lambda/88$
(Jiménez et al. 2016). This guide covers the critical-coupling condition that
makes perfect absorption possible, the slow-sound slit panel implemented in
the library, and the classical resonant absorbers re-read through the same
lens.

## 1. Critical coupling: when loss exactly balances leakage

A rigidly backed absorber panel is a one-port resonator: sound enters through
the face, rings inside, and either leaks back out or is dissipated. Its
reflection coefficient over the complex frequency plane has a pole and a zero
for each resonance. Two rates compete at the resonance: the **leakage rate**,
how fast the stored energy radiates back into the incident medium, and the
**intrinsic loss rate**, how fast the visco-thermal boundary layers of the
structure dissipate it.

- Too little loss (an almost lossless panel) and the energy mostly leaks back
  out: the reflection dips but recovers, $|R| > 0$.
- Too much loss (an over-damped panel) and the wave barely enters: the panel
  starts to look rigid again, $|R| > 0$ from the other side.
- When the two rates are **equal**, the zero of the reflection coefficient
  lands exactly on the real-frequency axis: at that frequency nothing is
  reflected, $R = 0$ and $\alpha = 1 - |R|^2 = 1$. This is the
  **critical-coupling condition** (Jiménez et al. 2017).

In impedance terms the same statement reads $Z = Z_0$: the panel's surface
impedance is purely resistive and matched to the incident medium,
$\mathrm{Re}(Z)\cos\theta = Z_0$ and $\mathrm{Im}(Z) = 0$. The condition says
nothing about thickness, which is exactly the loophole metamaterial absorbers
exploit: make the resonance deep-subwavelength with slow sound, then tune the
loss to match. The balance is delicate by design, and the library's
`critical_coupling_design` solves it numerically rather than by trial: at the
returned geometry the normalised impedance sits at $1 + 0j$ and the
reflection at zero.

```python
import numpy as np
from phonometry import (
    HelmholtzResonator, critical_coupling_design, slit_helmholtz_absorber,
)

base = HelmholtzResonator(
    neck_length=1.0e-3, neck_side=3.0e-3,
    cavity_length=30.0e-3, cavity_side=27.0e-3,
)
design = critical_coupling_design(300.0, base, lattice_step=3.0e-2, period=5.0e-2)

f = np.array([300.0])
res = slit_helmholtz_absorber(
    f, design.resonator, slit_height=design.slit_height,
    lattice_step=3.0e-2, period=5.0e-2,
)
z = res.normalized_impedance[0]
print(round(z.real, 2), round(z.imag, 2))       # 1.0 -0.0  (matched)
print(round(float(np.abs(res.reflection[0])), 3))   # 0.0   (reflection zero)
```

## 2. The slow-sound slit panel

A rigid panel of thin closed slits, each loaded on its upper wall by an array
of Helmholtz resonators, is a locally reacting, deep-subwavelength absorber
(Jiménez et al. 2017). The resonators slow the sound in the slit, pulling its
resonance far below the quarter-wavelength frequency, and the visco-thermal
losses of the sub-millimetre slit and the resonator necks make *perfect*
absorption possible: when the intrinsic loss balances the leakage, the
reflection zero lands on the real-frequency axis and $\alpha = 1$ (critical
coupling). The panel transfer matrix is the chain
$T = M_{\Delta l}\,\prod_n (M_s\,M_{HR}^{(n)}\,M_s)$; the rigidly-backed
reflection factor is
$R = (T_{11}\cos\theta - Z_0 T_{21})/(T_{11}\cos\theta + Z_0 T_{21})$ with
$Z_0 = \rho_0 c_0 / S_0$. The slit uses the narrow-channel visco-thermal
parameters and the square necks and cavities the rectangular-duct series of
Stinson (1991). `critical_coupling_design` inverts the model, tuning
the cavity length and the slit height so both matching conditions
$\mathrm{Re}(Z)\cos\theta = Z_0$ and $\mathrm{Im}(Z) = 0$ hold.

```python
import numpy as np
from phonometry import (
    HelmholtzResonator, critical_coupling_design, slit_helmholtz_absorber,
)

base = HelmholtzResonator(
    neck_length=1.0e-3, neck_side=3.0e-3,
    cavity_length=30.0e-3, cavity_side=27.0e-3,
)
design = critical_coupling_design(300.0, base, lattice_step=3.0e-2, period=5.0e-2)
print(round(design.absorption, 4))          # ~1.0 (perfect absorption)

f = np.linspace(150.0, 500.0, 700)
res = slit_helmholtz_absorber(
    f, design.resonator, slit_height=design.slit_height,
    lattice_step=3.0e-2, period=5.0e-2,
)
res.plot()   # alpha(f) with |R| overlaid; peak = 1 at 300 Hz
```

The solved geometry is worth a look before the absorption curve. The
resonator draws itself with `.plot()` and the panel result with
`.plot_geometry()`, both dimensioned and to scale.

The clip below drives this exact cell in a virtual plane-wave tube: the
sub-millimetre slit and its resonator are meshed on the FDTD grid and filled
with the model's visco-thermal effective fluids. At the design slit height
the standing wave collapses and the tone dies inside the panel; at 1.7 times
the height the loss balance breaks and the reflection rebuilds it.

## 3. How slow is the sound?

The name of the mechanism is measurable. The transfer-matrix result retains
the retrieved effective wavenumber of the loaded slit, so the phase speed
inside it is one division away, and the comparison with the empty slit says
everything about why the panel can be thin:

```python
import numpy as np
from phonometry import (
    HelmholtzResonator, critical_coupling_design, slit_helmholtz_absorber,
)

base = HelmholtzResonator(
    neck_length=1.0e-3, neck_side=3.0e-3,
    cavity_length=30.0e-3, cavity_side=27.0e-3,
)
design = critical_coupling_design(300.0, base, lattice_step=3.0e-2, period=5.0e-2)
res = slit_helmholtz_absorber(
    np.array([300.0]), design.resonator, slit_height=design.slit_height,
    lattice_step=3.0e-2, period=5.0e-2,
)

# Phase speed of the slit mode at the design frequency, from k_eff.
c_eff = 2 * np.pi * 300.0 / res.effective_wavenumber[0].real
print(round(float(c_eff), 1))               # 37.0   [m/s]
print(round(float(c_eff / 343.0), 2))       # 0.11   about a ninth of c0

# Quarter-wave resonance of the 30 mm depth: plain air vs the loaded slit.
print(round(343.0 / (4 * 0.03)))            # 2858   [Hz] empty slit
print(round(float(c_eff) / (4 * 0.03)))     # 308    [Hz] loaded slit
```

Below their resonance the shunt resonators add compliance to the slit without
adding moving mass, and the phase speed falls to about a ninth of the free-air
value. The 30 mm slit that would resonate at 2.9 kHz empty resonates at
about 300 Hz loaded, which is precisely where the critical-coupling design of
section 1 places its reflection zero. Slow sound moves the resonance into the
deep-subwavelength regime; critical coupling then makes that resonance
perfectly absorbing.

## 4. Classical resonant absorbers through the same lens

Critical coupling is not exclusive to metamaterials; it is the organising
principle hiding inside the classical resonant absorbers of the
[porous and multilayer guide](porous-absorbers.md):

- **The microperforated panel is a critically coupled absorber avant la
  lettre.** Maa's peak absorption $4r/(1+r)^2$ equals one exactly when the
  normalised resistance $r = 1$, which is the impedance-matching condition of
  section 1 stated for a locally reacting sheet. An MPP over a cavity tuned
  to $r = 1$ is doing precisely what the slit panel does, with the viscous
  loss provided by submillimetre holes instead of a submillimetre slit; what
  it cannot do is slow the sound. Its peak is the mass-spring resonance of
  the hole mass against the cavity compliance; conventional designs land
  the cavity around a tenth to a twentieth of a wavelength, so without the
  slow-sound compression the construction stops severalfold short of the
  loaded slit's depth.
- **Membrane and decorated-membrane absorbers** trade the hole viscosity for
  the flexural loss of a limp sheet; the same loss-versus-leakage balance
  governs their peak, and adding masses to the membrane (the decorated
  membrane of the metamaterials literature) tunes the resonance downward the
  way the loading resonators tune the slit.
- **The design question is always the same.** Pick the resonance with the
  geometry, then match the loss to the leakage. The porous-layer models ask
  "how thick"; the resonant family asks "how lossy", and
  `critical_coupling_design` answers it for the slit panel exactly.

The price of resonance is bandwidth: a critically coupled peak is narrow, and
away from it the panel reflects like the rigid wall it almost is. Broadband
metamaterial absorbers stack detuned cells side by side (the iridescent
absorber of Jiménez et al. 2017 chains resonators of graded dimensions for
exactly this reason); in the library the spectrum of any candidate geometry comes
from `slit_helmholtz_absorber` over a frequency array, so a graded design is
a loop over cells.

## Standards

No standard governs these prediction models; they are journal methods
(Jiménez et al. 2016/2017; Stinson 1991) implemented clean-room from the
cited sources. The model is pinned to its exact analytic anchors: the
critical-coupling design reaches $\alpha = 1$ at the design frequency, the
slit and square-duct effective densities reduce to the Poiseuille flow
resistivities $12\eta/h^2$ and $28.454\eta/w^2$ as $\omega \to 0$, and the
effective parameters tend to $\rho_0$, $\kappa_0$ as the boundary layers
vanish. A built panel would be measured in the
[impedance tube](impedance-tube.md) (ISO 10534-2) or the
[reverberation room](absorption-measurement.md) (ISO 354); misprints found in
the source papers during this work are recorded in the
[errata registry](../../ERRATA.md).
