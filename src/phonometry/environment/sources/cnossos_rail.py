CNOSSOS-EU railway source emission (Directive 2002/49/EC Annex II, 2.3).

The common noise assessment methods of the European Union describe a railway
track as **two** incoherent source lines at the centre of the track, at
:math:`h = 0.5` m (source A) and :math:`h = 4.0` m (source B) above the plane
tangent to
the two upper rail surfaces. Every physical source of a vehicle is allocated to
one of the two heights and contributes a directional sound power per metre of
line

.. math::

   L'_{W,eq,line,i}(\psi,\phi) = L_{W,0,dir,i}(\psi,\phi)
   + 10 \log_{10}\left( \frac{Q}{1000 v} \right) \tag{2.3.2}

for a running train, or :math:`+\, 10 \log_{10}(T_{idle} / (T_{ref} L))` (2.3.4)
for an idling
one. This module implements the whole of 2.3 together with the coefficient
database of Appendix G, in the twenty-four 1/3-octave bands from 50 Hz to
10 kHz, and energy-sums them into the eight octave bands the propagation stage
consumes.

Which text is implemented
-------------------------
Annex II was replaced by Commission Directive (EU) 2015/996, corrected by the
corrigendum of OJ L 5, 10.1.2018 and amended by Commission Delegated Directive
(EU) 2021/1226. The consolidated text (02002L0049) is what is implemented here,
and every shipped table records the instrument it comes from:

* the roughness-to-frequency conversion uses :math:`f = v/\lambda` with
  **v in m/s**
  as corrected in 2018 (the 2015 text says km/h, which is wrong by a factor
  3.6);
* the whole of Appendix G is the corrigendum's replacement text, with Tables
  G-1b, G-2, G-3a, G-4 and G-7 as **replaced** by (EU) 2021/1226 and Tables
  G-1a, G-3b, G-3c, G-5 and G-6 as re-issued in 2018 with the band labels
  corrected in 2021;
* curve squeal follows the 2021 rule (5 dB / 8 dB by radius, with a separate
  tram rule and a turnout rule), not the 2015 one;
* bridge noise is a **separate source** built on the transfer function
  ``L_H,bridge,i`` of Table G-7 (2.3.18 as replaced in 2021), not the constant
  ``C_bridge`` of 2015;
* the vertical directivity of source A is the 2021 form, with no absolute-value
  bars and identically zero for :math:`\psi \le 0`. The superseded 2015 form is
  available through :class:`DirectivityEdition` for comparison with pre-2021
  studies, because the two differ over the whole lower half space.

What is verified against digits and what is not
-----------------------------------------------
Annex II prints **no worked example** for the railway source. The end-to-end
chain implemented here is pinned against the emission test workbook published
with the Commission's CNOSSOS-EU source module, which was computed with the
**2015** coefficient database; the shipped tables are therefore verified as
transcriptions, and the equations that combine them are verified end to end
against an independent implementation. Two points are interpretation, not
transcription, and are documented as such:
:class:`RoughnessInterpolation` (the Directive describes the wavelength-to-
frequency resampling in prose only) and the horizontal directivity of traction
noise (2.3.15 enumerates rolling, impact, squeal, braking, fans and aerodynamic
effects; the reference module applies the dipole to every source, which is what
is done here).

Scope
-----
This is the **emission** stage only. Splitting a source line into equivalent
point sources is explicitly outside the scope of the method (2.5.3), and the
CNOSSOS propagation model is not ISO 9613-2, so the hand-off to
:mod:`~phonometry.environment.propagation.outdoor_propagation` mixes two methods and is a
convenience, not a normative chain.
