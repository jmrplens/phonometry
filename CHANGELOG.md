## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `VibrationSoundPowerResult.report()`: a one-page PDF
  sound-power-from-vibration determination fiche for the airborne sound power a
  machine radiates through its surface vibration (ISO/TS 7849-1/-2:2009),
  rendered through the shared sound-power report engine. The sheet carries the
  standard-basis line naming the applied method (the ISO/TS 7849-1 survey
  method with a fixed radiation factor `ε = 1`, or the ISO/TS 7849-2
  engineering method with a determined radiation factor), an optional metadata
  header (client, machine/source, test environment, instrumentation, climate,
  date), a per-band table of the surface vibratory velocity level `Lv` and the
  radiated band sound-power level `LW`, the sound-power spectrum `LW(f)` with a
  nominal band axis, and a boxed A-weighted sound power level `LWA` (dB re
  1 pW) with the total `LW`, the radiating area `S` and the applied method. A
  declared A-weighted sound-power limit supplied via the metadata `requirement`
  adds a PASS/FAIL verdict (lower is better). `verbose=True` adds the radiation
  factor `ε` column; the basis strip states the sound-power relation
  `LW = Lv + 10 lg(S/S0) + 10 lg(ε) + 10 lg(411/400)` with its fixed impedance
  term and the radiation-factor model. `language="es"` renders the Spanish
  fiche. `VibrationSoundPowerResult` gains a `sound_power_level_a` property (the
  A-weighted total). The fiche reuses the shared sound-power body (per-band
  table, `LW(f)` spectrum, boxed `LWA` and flow assembly) already used by the
  ISO 3744/3745/3741/9614 fiches.
- `ReverberationSoundPowerResult.report()`: a one-page PDF reverberation-room
  sound-power determination fiche for the precision method in a qualified
  hard-walled reverberation test room (ISO 3741:2010, accuracy grade 1),
  rendered through the shared sound-power report engine. The sheet carries the
  standard-basis line naming the reverberation-room method (the direct method
  using the room equivalent absorption area, Eq. 20, or the comparison method
  using a reference sound source, Eq. 21) and the precision accuracy grade, an
  optional metadata header (client, noise source, reverberation test room,
  instrumentation, climate, date), a per-band table of the mean room
  sound-pressure level `Lp` and the band sound-power level `LW`, the
  sound-power spectrum `LW(f)` with a nominal band axis, and a boxed A-weighted
  sound power level `LWA` (dB re 1 pW) with the total `LW` and the
  determination method. A declared A-weighted sound-power limit supplied via
  the metadata `requirement` adds a PASS/FAIL verdict (lower is better).
  `verbose=True` adds the background correction `K1` and, for the direct
  method, the equivalent absorption area `A` and the Waterhouse boundary
  correction `Cw`; the basis strip states the correction model (Eq. 20 or
  Eq. 21), the applied meteorological corrections `C1`/`C2` and the speed of
  sound, and cites the Annex F A-weighting. `language="es"` renders the Spanish
  fiche. The fiche reuses the shared sound-power body (per-band table, `LW(f)`
  spectrum, boxed `LWA` and flow assembly) already used by the ISO 3744/3745
  pressure fiche and the ISO 9614-2 intensity fiche.
- `AirbornePredictionResult.report()` and `ImpactPredictionResult.report()`: a
  one-page PDF **prediction** report for the predicted building sound insulation
  between rooms (EN/ISO 12354-1 apparent sound reduction index `R'`) and of
  floors (EN/ISO 12354-2 apparent normalized impact sound pressure level
  `L'n`), computed by the simplified single-number model (direct plus flanking
  transmission). Each sheet is clearly labelled a prediction, never a
  measurement: a standard-basis line naming EN/ISO 12354-1/-2 and the ISO 717
  rating part, an optional metadata header (separating element, area, room
  geometry, bare-floor mass, calculator/laboratory, date), a two-panel body with
  the model-term table on the left (the direct path and each flanking path's
  weighted index `Rij,w` for airborne, or the Formula (21) terms `Ln,w,eq`,
  `ΔLw` and `K` for impact) beside the result's own plot, the boxed predicted
  single number (`R'w` / `L'n,w`) and a statement reporting the model's ~2 dB
  standard deviation. A supplied requirement adds a PASS/FAIL verdict (airborne
  passes at or above it, impact at or below it); `verbose=True` annexes each
  airborne path's share of the transmitted energy; `language="es"` renders the
  Spanish fiche. The fiche reuses the shared report layout toolkit
  (`phonometry[report]` extra).
- `SoundPowerIntensityResult.report()`: a one-page PDF sound-power-by-intensity
  determination fiche for the sound-intensity scanning method
  (ISO 9614-2:1996, engineering grade 2 or survey grade 3), rendered through
  the shared sound-power report engine. The sheet carries the standard-basis
  line naming the scanning method and its measurement grade, an optional
  metadata header (client, noise source, test environment, instrumentation,
  climate, date), a per-band table of the intensity-derived band sound-power
  level `LW` (net-negative, non-determinable bands shown as an em dash), the
  sound-power spectrum `LW(f)` with a nominal band axis, and a boxed A-weighted
  sound power level `LWA` (dB re 1 pW) with the total `LW`, the measurement
  surface area `S` and the determination grade. A declared A-weighted
  sound-power limit supplied via the metadata `requirement` adds a PASS/FAIL
  verdict (lower is better). `verbose=True` adds the field indicators `FpI`
  (surface pressure-intensity) and `F+/-` (negative partial power) and the
  per-band achieved grade; the basis strip states the partial-power model and
  the Annex B qualification criteria. `language="es"` renders the Spanish
  fiche. The shared sound-power body (per-band table, `LW(f)` spectrum, boxed
  `LWA` and flow assembly) is now factored into a common renderer used by both
  the ISO 3744/3745 pressure fiche and this ISO 9614-2 intensity fiche.
- `DynamicStiffnessResult.report()`: a one-page PDF dynamic-stiffness
  test-report fiche rendered through the shared accredited-report engine
  (EN 29052-1:1992, identical to ISO 9052-1:1989, the load-plate resonance
  method for the dynamic stiffness of resilient materials under floating
  floors). The sheet carries the standard-basis line, an optional metadata
  header (client, specimen, the total mass per unit area `m't` used during the
  test, the loaded specimen thickness `d`, test facility, climate), a metrics
  table (the resonant frequency `fr`, the apparent dynamic stiffness `s't` of
  Formula 4, the enclosed-gas term `s'a` of Formula 7 when it applies, the
  installed dynamic stiffness `s'` of Clause 8.2 and the supported-floor natural
  frequency `f0` of Formula 2) beside the `f0(s')` design curve, and a boxed
  apparent dynamic stiffness `s't` with the installed `s'` and the resonance
  `fr` alongside. Clause 9 rounds every dynamic stiffness to the nearest MN/m³;
  it is a characterisation, so there is no pass/fail verdict. `language="es"`
  renders the Spanish fiche. `ReportMetadata` gains a `thickness` field (the
  loaded specimen thickness, EN 29052-1:1992 Clause 9 b).
- `ImpulseProminenceResult.report()`: a one-page PDF impulsive-sound prominence
  assessment fiche rendered through the shared accredited-report engine
  (NT ACOU 112:2002, carried into ISO/PAS 1996-3:2022). The sheet carries the
  standard-basis line, an optional metadata header (source/situation, client,
  measurement position, instrumentation, date, with the 30-minute assessment
  period always shown), a per-impulse table of the onset rate, level difference,
  predicted prominence `P` and the onset-rate qualification beside the `KI(P)`
  adjustment-curve plot with the candidate impulses marked, and the boxed
  governing prominence `P` together with the derived `LAeq` adjustment `KI`
  (Formula 2), with a prominence-category note (prominent / not). A maximum
  acceptable governing prominence supplied via the metadata `requirement` adds a
  PASS/FAIL verdict (a less prominent impulse passes); `language="es"` renders
  the Spanish fiche.
- `IntensityReductionResult.report()`: a one-page PDF intensity
  sound-insulation test-report fiche rendered through the shared
  accredited-report engine (ISO 15186-1:2000, laboratory measurement of sound
  insulation using sound intensity). The sheet carries the standard-basis line,
  an optional metadata header (client, specimen, sample area `S`, room volumes,
  test room, climate), the one-third-octave table of the intensity sound
  reduction index `RI` beside the measured-versus-shifted-reference curve, and
  the boxed single-number rating `RI,w (C; Ctr)` (evaluated per ISO 717-1:2020),
  followed by the statement that the transmitted sound power was measured
  directly over the measurement surface. A minimum rating supplied via the
  metadata `requirement` adds a PASS/FAIL verdict (a higher rating passes).
  `verbose=True` annexes the `Kc`-modified index `RI,M` beside `RI` when an
  Annex B adaptation term is present; `language="es"` renders the Spanish fiche.
- `FloorCoveringImprovementResult.report()`: a one-page PDF floor-covering
  impact-improvement test-report fiche rendered through the shared
  accredited-report engine (BS EN ISO 16251-1:2014, the small-mock-up
  laboratory method for the reduction of transmitted impact sound by soft floor
  coverings). The sheet carries the standard-basis line, an optional metadata
  header (client, floor-covering description, mounting, mass per unit area, the
  measured frequency range, climate), the one-third-octave table of the
  reduction of impact sound pressure level `ΔL` (bands at the 1,3 dB limit of
  measurement prefixed `>`) beside the `ΔL(f)` improvement curve, and the boxed
  single-number weighted improvement `ΔLw (CI,Δ)` (the ISO 16251-1 Clause 8 e)
  statement of results, rated per ISO 717-2:2020; a characterisation headline
  replaces it when the spectrum lacks the 16 rating bands 100 Hz to 3150 Hz). A
  minimum weighted improvement supplied via the metadata `requirement` adds a
  PASS/FAIL verdict (a higher weighted improvement passes). `verbose=True` adds
  the reference-floor-with-covering column `Ln,r = Ln,r,0 - ΔL` (the ISO 717-2
  derivation basis of `ΔLw`); `language="es"` renders the Spanish fiche.
- `ScatteringResult.report()`, `DiffusionSpectrum.report()` and
  `DiffusionResult.report()`: one-page PDF surface-scattering and diffusion
  test-report fiches rendered through the shared accredited-report engine
  (ISO 17497-1:2004+A1:2014 and ISO 17497-2:2012). The scattering fiche carries
  the standard-basis line, an optional metadata header (client, specimen,
  sample area `S`, room volume `V`, test room, climate), a per-one-third-octave
  table of the random-incidence absorption `alpha_s` and the scattering
  coefficient `s` beside the `s(f)` curve on a categorical band axis, and a
  boxed characterisation headline; `verbose=True` adds the specular absorption
  `alpha_spec` column. The diffusion-spectrum fiche tabulates the diffusion
  coefficient `d` per band beside the `d(f)` band-axis curve (the per-band
  random-incidence coefficient being the average of the directional coefficients
  over the source positions, Clause 8.4); `verbose=True` adds the normalised
  `d_n` column. The polar-response fiche tabulates the corrected reflected level
  `L` per receiver angle beside the semicircular polar plot, boxing the
  directional diffusion coefficient. ISO 17497 is a characterisation, so there
  is no pass/fail verdict. `language="es"` renders the Spanish fiche. A new
  `DiffusionSpectrum` result (and its `diffusion_spectrum` constructor) carries
  the diffusion coefficient across the measured bands, with `.plot()` and
  `.report()`.
- `ToneAudibilityResult.report()`: a one-page PDF tonal audibility assessment
  fiche rendered through the shared accredited-report engine, following the
  ISO 1996-2:2017 Annex J engineering method (ISO/PAS 20065:2016). The sheet
  carries the standard-basis line, an optional metadata header (source/situation,
  client, measurement position, instrumentation and date, with the analysis line
  spacing `Δf` read from the result), a full-width table of the key quantities for
  every detected tone (tone frequency `fT`, entry type, tone level `Lpt`,
  critical-band masking-noise level `Lpn`, critical bandwidth `Δfc` and the
  audibility `ΔLta`) above a level-versus-frequency analysis plot with the tones
  and their critical-band masking noise marked, and a boxed decisive audibility
  `ΔLta` with the derived tonal adjustment `K` (ISO 1996-2:2017 Table J.1). A
  maximum-audibility limit supplied via the metadata `requirement` adds a
  PASS/FAIL verdict (a quieter tone passes), and a prominence note states whether
  a prominent tone is present. `verbose=True` adds the per-tone extended
  uncertainty column; `language="es"` renders the Spanish fiche.
- `ImpedanceTubeResult.report()`: a one-page PDF impedance-tube test-report
  fiche rendered through the shared accredited-report engine (BS EN ISO
  10534-2:2001, two-microphone transfer-function method). The sheet carries the
  standard-basis line, an optional metadata header (client, specimen, tube
  diameter `d`, microphone spacing `s`, the measured frequency range, mounting,
  climate), a per-frequency table of the normal-incidence absorption
  coefficient `alpha` with the real and imaginary parts of the normalised
  surface impedance `z = Z/(rho c0)` beside the `alpha(f)` curve on a continuous
  logarithmic frequency axis, and a boxed characterisation headline (ISO 10534-2
  is a characterisation, so there is no pass/fail verdict and no single-number
  rating). `verbose=True` adds the reflection-factor magnitude `|r|` column, and
  `language="es"` renders the Spanish fiche. `ReportMetadata` gains the
  `tube_diameter` and `mic_spacing` geometry fields (in metres, printed in
  millimetres). The `ImpedanceTubeResult.plot()` absorption spectrum now uses a
  continuous logarithmic frequency axis with band-centre labels.
- `SoundPowerResult.report()` and `PrecisionSoundPowerResult.report()`: a
  one-page PDF sound-power determination fiche rendered through the shared
  accredited-report engine. The sheet carries the standard-basis line naming
  the applied method and accuracy grade (ISO 3744:2010 engineering grade 2 /
  ISO 3746:2010 survey grade 3 / ISO 3745:2012 precision grade 1), an optional
  metadata header, a per-band table (nominal octave/one-third-octave frequency,
  the surface sound-pressure level `Lp` and the band sound-power level `LW`,
  grouped by octave for a one-third-octave set), the sound-power spectrum
  `LW(f)` with a nominal band axis, and a boxed A-weighted sound power level
  `LWA` (dB re 1 pW) with the total `LW`, the expanded uncertainty `U` and the
  measurement surface area `S`. A declared limit supplied via the metadata
  `requirement` adds a PASS/FAIL verdict (lower is better). `verbose=True` adds
  the energy-averaged level `Lp'`, and for the ISO 3744/3746 surface result it
  also adds the background (`K1`) and environmental (`K2`) correction columns;
  the ISO 3745 precision result carries no `K1`/`K2`, so its basis strip states
  the meteorological corrections (`C1`/`C2`/`C3`) instead. `language="es"`
  renders the Spanish fiche.
- `LabAirborneInsulationResult.report()` and `LabImpactInsulationResult.report()`:
  the one-page laboratory sound-insulation test report of ISO 10140-2:2010
  (airborne sound reduction index `R`) and ISO 10140-3:2010 (normalized impact
  sound pressure level `Ln`), rendered to PDF and laid out like the accredited
  laboratory reports rated per ISO 717. The sheet carries the standard-basis
  line, an optional metadata header (client, specimen, mounting, sample area,
  room volumes, climatic conditions), the one-third-octave (or octave) table
  beside the measured-versus-shifted-reference curve, the boxed laboratory
  rating `Rw (C; Ctr)` (ISO 717-1) or `Ln,w (CI)` (ISO 717-2) evaluated by the
  existing weighted-rating engine, the statement that the evaluation rests on a
  laboratory precision method, and a footer with the fixed disclaimer.
  `verbose=True` annexes the per-band equivalent absorption area `A = 0,16 V/T`
  (ISO 10140-4:2010) beside the reported quantity. A verdict row appears only
  when a target is supplied through `metadata.requirement` (airborne passes at
  or above it, impact at or below it). `language="es"` renders the Spanish
  fiche with a comma decimal separator.
- `standard_speech_spectra()` and the `StandardSpeechSpectrum` result: a thin,
  plottable wrapper around `standard_speech_spectrum()` (ANSI S3.5-1997 Table 3)
  that carries the 18 one-third-octave band centre frequencies and the standard
  speech spectrum level of one or more vocal efforts (`normal`, `raised`,
  `loud`, `shout`). Its `.plot()` draws the standard speech spectrum level (dB
  SPL) over the categorical one-third-octave band axis, one labelled line per
  vocal effort, so the whole spectrum lifting with vocal effort reads at a
  glance. The band levels are unchanged; `standard_speech_spectrum()` still
  returns the bare per-band array. `language="es"` renders the Spanish labels.
- `seabed_reflection()` and the `SeabedReflection` result: a thin, plottable
  wrapper around `reflection_coefficient()` (fluid-fluid Rayleigh seabed) that
  carries the grazing-angle grid, the complex reflection coefficient, its
  magnitude `|R|`, the bottom loss in dB, the critical angle and the interface
  parameters (`rho1`, `c1`, `rho2`, `c2`). Its `.plot()` draws the
  reflection-coefficient magnitude `|R|` on a linear grazing-angle axis, marking
  the critical angle; `language="es"` renders the Spanish labels. The underlying
  `reflection_coefficient()` maths is unchanged.
- `k_weighting_response()` and `KWeightingResponse`: the K-weighting pre-filter
  of ITU-R BS.1770-5 (Annex 1) evaluated as a magnitude frequency response. The
  constructor evaluates the same Table 1-2 biquads that `k_weighting` applies
  (from `k_weighting_coefficients`, so nothing is re-derived) and returns a
  frozen result carrying the combined magnitude in dB, each of the two stages
  (the +4 dB spherical-head shelf and the RLB high-pass) and the frequency
  grid. Its `.plot()` draws the response on a logarithmic frequency axis, the
  combined curve with the two stages as light companions; `language="es"`
  renders the Spanish labels.
- `piston_directivity_pattern()` and the `PistonDirectivity` result: the
  far-field directivity of a rigid baffled circular piston
  (`D(theta) = 2 J1(ka sin theta)/(ka sin theta)`, Beranek & Mellow Eq. (4.42))
  is now a plottable result carrying the polar-angle grid, the linear
  directivity and its dB form and the `ka` value(s). Its `.plot()` draws the
  classic polar beam pattern in dB over the front hemisphere; passing several
  `ka` shows them as one family, so the main lobe narrowing and the emergence
  of the side lobes read at a glance. `language="es"` renders the Spanish
  labels. The underlying `piston_directivity()` maths is unchanged.
- `atmospheric_attenuation()` and the `AtmosphericAttenuation` result: a thin,
  plottable wrapper around `air_attenuation()` (ISO 9613-1:1993) that carries the
  frequency grid, the pure-tone attenuation coefficient `alpha` and the
  atmospheric conditions (temperature, relative humidity, pressure). Its
  `.plot()` draws the classic `alpha`-versus-frequency curve in dB/km on a
  logarithmic frequency axis, and an optional `distance` exposes the total
  attenuation `A = alpha * d` over the path (`total_attenuation`, the ISO 9613-2
  `Aatm`). The maths is unchanged; `air_attenuation()` still returns the bare
  coefficient array. `language="es"` renders the Spanish labels.
- `TrendTestResult.plot()`: a one-line canonical figure for the nonparametric
  trend test (Bendat & Piersol, *Random Data* Sec. 4.5.2), mirroring the
  companion `StationarityTestResult.plot()`. It draws the tested sequence
  against its sample index and states the outcome in the legend: the
  reverse-arrangement count `A` (or the run count `r`), the Table A.6
  acceptance region and whether the no-trend hypothesis is accepted; for
  `method="runs"` it also marks the sequence median that classifies each
  value. `language="es"` renders the Spanish labels.
- `RigidMassCalibrationResult.plot()`: the ISO 7626-2 (7.5.2) operational
  rigid-mass calibration check as a single-concept, two-panel figure. The upper
  panel draws the measured driving-point FRF magnitude against the known
  rigid-mass line (`|A| = 1/m` for accelerance, `|Y| = 1/(2πf·m)` for mobility)
  with its ±5 % tolerance band; the lower panel draws the relative deviation
  against the same band, where a few-percent tolerance is actually readable.
  Frequencies outside the band are drawn in the out-of-tolerance colour and the
  title carries the overall verdict. Passing an existing axes draws only the
  deviation diagnostic on it; `language="es"` renders Spanish labels.
- `MultipleShockResult.report()`: a one-page PDF whole-body multiple-shock
  health-risk assessment fiche (ISO 2631-5:2018), laid out like a health-risk
  assessment sheet. The sheet carries the standard-basis line (Clause 5 spinal
  response and the Annex C risk model), an optional metadata header (client,
  subject, workplace/vehicle, instrumentation, calibration), the
  exposure-scenario grid (subject sex, the age `b` at which the exposure
  started, the number of exposure years `n`, the number of exposure days per
  year `N` and the number of counted response shocks), the dose-and-stress
  analysis table (the acceleration dose `Dz` of Formula 3, the daily dose `Dzd`
  of Formula 4, the daily compressive stress `Sd` of Formula C.1, the
  cumulative stress variable `R` of Formula C.3 and the probability of lumbar
  injury `P` of Formula C.5), the result's own injury-probability chart, the
  boxed `R` and `P` with the Annex C risk classification, and a classification
  table against the Table C.2 stress variables for 10 / 50 / 90 % risk of
  injury (low / moderate / high / very high probability of an adverse health
  effect) with a risk-band zone row. Because ISO 2631-5:2018 defines no
  exposure limit, the fiche carries the informative risk-band classification
  rather than a PASS/FAIL verdict. `language="es"` renders the Spanish fiche
  with a comma decimal separator.
- `equal_loudness_contours()` and the `EqualLoudnessContours` result type for
  the ISO 226:2023 normal equal-loudness-level contours. The function bundles a
  family of contours (20 phon to 90 phon in 10 phon steps by default) with the
  threshold of hearing over a shared frequency grid, reusing the existing
  `equal_loudness_contour()` and `hearing_threshold()` for all maths. The
  result exposes `.plot()`, which draws the iconic ISO 226 chart (sound
  pressure level versus a logarithmic frequency axis, one line per loudness
  level plus the threshold) in English or Spanish. The bare-array functions are
  unchanged.
- `LoudspeakerCharacteristics.plot(quantity=...)`: single-concept IEC 60268-5
  rated-characteristic figures selected by `quantity`: `"response"` (the on-axis
  SPL response with its tolerance band and effective-range markers, the
  default), `"impedance"` (the modulus `|Z|` with the rated and 80 %-of-rated
  lines), `"thd"` (total harmonic distortion against frequency) and
  `"directivity"` (the polar response on the 25 dB reference circle). Each call
  returns a single Axes and shares its panel drawing with the `.report()` fiche,
  so the plot and the report never diverge. An unknown `quantity` raises
  `ValueError`; `language="es"` labels the figure in Spanish.
- `MicrophoneCharacteristics.plot(quantity=...)`: single-concept IEC 60268-4
  rated-characteristic figures selected by `quantity`: `"response"` (the
  free-field response with its tolerance band, reference-frequency and
  effective-range markers, the default), `"directivity"` (the polar directional
  pattern on the 25 dB reference circle), `"noise"` (the inherent-noise band
  spectrum) and `"distortion"` (total harmonic distortion against sound pressure
  level). Each call returns a single Axes and shares its panel drawing with the
  `.report()` fiche. An unknown `quantity` raises `ValueError`; `language="es"`
  labels the figure in Spanish.
- `OpenPlanResult.report()`: a one-page PDF open-plan office acoustics fiche
  (ISO 3382-3:2012), laid out like a speech-privacy measurement report. The
  sheet carries the standard-basis line, an optional metadata header (client,
  office/zone, description, floor area, source and measurement positions,
  climate), a metrics table of the four single-number quantities of Clause 4
  (the spatial decay rate of A-weighted speech `D2,S`, the nominal 4 m speech
  level `Lp,A,S,4m`, the distraction distance `rD` and the privacy distance
  `rP`), the result's own spatial-decay plot (the Clause 6.2 regression on the
  logarithmic distance axis with the 4 m read-off and the `rD` / `rP`
  crossings), the boxed `D2,S` with the remaining quantities alongside, and a
  footer with the fixed disclaimer. A verdict row appears only when a target
  spatial decay rate is supplied through `metadata.requirement` (read as the
  minimum acceptable `D2,S`, per the informative quality ranges of Annex A; the
  room passes at or above it). `language="es"` renders the Spanish fiche with a
  comma decimal separator.
- `DailyVibrationExposure.report()`: a one-page PDF daily vibration exposure
  assessment fiche for hand-arm (ISO 5349-1/-2:2001) and whole-body
  (ISO 2631-1:1997) exposure, laid out like the hand-arm and whole-body
  exposure calculators of occupational-hygiene practice. The sheet carries the
  standard-basis line naming the applied ISO method and the assessment
  directive, an optional metadata header (company, operator/worker, workplace,
  instrumentation, calibration), the per-operation exposure analysis (each
  operation's vibration total value, its daily exposure time `T_i` and the
  partial exposure `A_i(8)` of ISO 5349-1/-2 Eq. (2), closed by the daily total
  and the combined `A(8)` of Eq. (3)) with the contribution chart, the boxed
  `A(8)` with its exposure zone, and an assessment table against the exposure
  action value (EAV) and exposure limit value (ELV) of Directive 2002/44/EC
  (Article 3): hand-arm 2.5 / 5 m/s², whole-body 0.5 / 1.15 m/s², each marked
  exceeded / not exceeded on the value rounded exactly as displayed, with a
  PASS/FAIL verdict against the limit value and a footer note that the ISO
  standards define no safe exposure limit. `verbose=True` adds each operation's
  share of the daily vibration energy, and `language="es"` renders the Spanish
  fiche (comma decimals). The committed example reproduces the ISO 5349-2:2001
  Annex E.3 forestry worker's day (A(8) = 3.6 m/s², action zone). Rendering
  needs the optional `phonometry[report]` extra (reportlab), plus matplotlib
  for the contribution chart.
- `time_synchronous_average`: extraction of a periodic waveform of known
  period from asynchronous noise by time domain averaging (P. D. McFadden,
  "A revised model for the extraction of periodic waveforms by time domain
  averaging", Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing 1(1), 1987, 83-95).
  Ensemble-averaging N successive periods (Eq. 5) reinforces every component
  synchronous with the period and suppresses the rest, with the residual
  asynchronous-noise standard deviation falling as 1/sqrt(N). The frozen
  `SynchronousAverageResult` carries the averaged one-period waveform, the
  residual and its RMS, the noise reduction in dB (10*log10(N)) with the
  sqrt(N) amplitude gain, the comb-filter response over the first harmonics,
  and a `.plot()` (EN/ES). When the sample rate does not divide the period
  the blocks are aligned to a common integer grid by the band-limited
  fractional delay of `fractional_delay`; an integer number of samples per
  period is recovered to machine precision. `comb_filter_response` evaluates
  the closed-form comb magnitude (Eq. 8/9), a Dirichlet kernel with unit
  teeth at the harmonics k/T and nodes at j/(N*T), so an interfering order is
  best rejected by choosing N to place a node on it (McFadden's 32.05-order
  example: N = 20 beats the power-of-two N = 32).
- `miso_coherence`: multiple and partial coherence of a multiple-input,
  single-output system (Bendat & Piersol, Random Data 4e, Chapter 7). From the
  Welch cross-spectral matrix of several partially correlated inputs and
  one output it reports the ordinary coherence of each input (Eq. 7.109), the
  multiple coherence explained by all inputs jointly (Eq. 7.35), and the
  partial coherences (Eq. 7.87) obtained by the Gaussian-elimination
  conditioning of Section 7.3, so a source that only correlates with the true
  cause is no longer credited for it. The frozen `MISOCoherenceResult` also
  carries the partial coherent output spectra that decompose the output power
  source by source (Eq. 7.86, with `sum(Gvi) + noise = Gyy`), the Section 9.3
  random errors, a `.dominant_input()` helper for the strongest source per
  band, and a `.plot()` (EN/ES). The conditioning is pinned to the exact
  rational values of Problem 7.2 and to the multiple-coherence SNR relation.
- `ExposureResult.report(path)` renders the ISO 9612:2009 Clause 15
  occupational noise-exposure measurement report as a one-page PDF fiche laid
  out like a prevention-service measurement sheet: the standard-basis line
  naming the applied strategy (task-based, job-based or full-day, Clauses
  9-11), a header grid with the new `ReportMetadata.instrumentation` and
  `ReportMetadata.calibration` free-text fields, the work-analysis table (per
  task the mean duration, sample count, task level of Formula 7 and
  contribution of Formula 8, or the Annex C sampling budget for the job-based
  and full-day strategies, with `verbose=True` adding the per-task uncertainty
  columns), the boxed LEX,8h with its expanded uncertainty U at the coverage
  factor k = 1.65, and the assessment against Directive 2003/10/EC (the 80/85
  dB(A) action values and the 87 dB(A) limit value, each marked on the value
  rounded exactly as displayed). English and Spanish. `ReportMetadata` gains
  the optional `instrumentation` and `calibration` fields.
- `metrology.equalizer`: parametric-equalizer biquads implementing the
  closed-form recipes of the RBJ Audio EQ Cookbook (republished as a W3C
  Working Group Note). `EQSection` specifies one biquad with the cookbook's
  exact parameterization (`peaking`, `lowshelf`, `highshelf`, `lowpass`,
  `highpass`, `bandpass`, `bandpass_skirt`, `notch`, `allpass`; `f0`,
  `gain_db`, and exactly one of `q`, `bw` in octaves or shelf `slope`), and
  `ParametricEQ` designs the sections and runs them as a normalized SOS cascade
  in the `WeightingFilter` house style (reusable `.sos`, 1D/2D multichannel
  `filter()`, optional stateful block processing). `ParametricEQ.response()`
  returns a frozen `EQResponseResult` with the per-section and cascade
  magnitude and phase and an i18n `.plot()`, and `parametric_eq(x, fs, sections)`
  is the one-shot helper. Verified against the cookbook's own closed forms (a
  hand-worked coefficient set pinned to 1e-15 and the exact type anchors at
  f0, DC and Nyquist).
- Three system-measurement front ends for the transfer-function toolbox, each
  returning a rich result with a `.plot()` and reusing the existing
  acquisition and deconvolution machinery. `golay_pair(order)` builds a
  complementary binary code pair of length `2**order` whose periodic
  autocorrelations sum to an exact `2L`-delta (Golay 1961; Xiang in Havelock,
  Handbook of Signal Processing in Acoustics, Part I Ch. 6), and
  `golay_impulse_response()` recovers the `ImpulseResponseResult`
  (`method="golay"`) exactly for a noiseless linear time-invariant system.
  `shaped_sweep_signal(...)` synthesizes a swept sine whose group delay grows
  in proportion to a target spectral power (`"pink"`, `"white"` or a
  `(frequencies_hz, magnitude_db)` pair) while keeping a swept sine's crest
  factor (Mueller & Massarani, JAES 49(6), 2001). `regularized_inverse_filter()`
  computes the frequency-dependent Tikhonov inverse of Kirkeby & Nelson
  (JAES 47(7/8), 1999), `H_inv = conj(H) / (|H|^2 + eps(f))`, small in-band and
  large outside, with the out-of-band gain capped at `1 / (2*sqrt(eps))` and a
  modeling delay that makes the mixed-phase inverse causal; `.apply()`
  equalizes a recording with the delay removed.
- `multitaper_psd`: Thomson multitaper spectral density (Thomson 1982;
  Percival & Walden 1993, Chapter 7) as the whole-record alternative to the
  Welch estimator for records too short to segment. K orthogonal Slepian
  (dpss) tapers - computed by `scipy.signal.windows.dpss`, their
  concentrations verified against Percival & Walden's quadruple-precision
  Table 382 - yield K nearly uncorrelated eigenspectra whose adaptively
  weighted average (P&W Eqs. 368a/370a, iterated to convergence) carries
  about 2K chi-square degrees of freedom from a single record. The frozen
  `MultitaperSpectralDensityResult` reports the per-frequency equivalent
  degrees of freedom (Eq. 370b), the chi-square confidence interval, the
  normalized random error, the combination weights and the taper
  concentrations, with `.plot()` (EN/ES) drawing the density and its
  confidence band; calibration (density/spectrum scaling, no detrending)
  matches the Welch estimators exactly.
- Random-data qualification module `phonometry.metrology.random_data`
  (Bendat & Piersol, Random Data 4e, Secs. 4.5.2, 10.3 and 5.5).
  `trend_test()` runs the nonparametric reverse arrangement test with the
  Table A.6 acceptance regions (reproduced exactly at alpha = 0.05 for
  N = 10 to 100, pinned in the conformance suite together with the book's
  Example 4.4) and an exact Mahonian p-value up to N = 100, or the classical
  runs test about the median with the exact Wald-Wolfowitz conditional
  distribution at any N. `stationarity_test()` applies either test to
  per-segment mean squares (or rms/mean/variance) of a single record, the
  Sec. 10.3.1.1 procedure, with a `.plot()` of the segment sequence and the
  verdict. `level_crossing_rate()` counts level crossings (both slopes) and
  compares them with the Rice expectations N0 = 2 sqrt(m2/m0) and
  Na = N0 exp(-a^2/2 sigma^2) from the record's own Welch autospectrum
  moments (Examples 5.12-5.14 verified as conformance rows), and
  `peak_statistics()` measures the rate of local maxima against
  M = sqrt(m4/m2), derives the irregularity factor r = N0/2M and exposes
  the Rice peak-height distribution (`peak_exceedance()`/`peak_density()`)
  that interpolates Rayleigh (r = 1) and Gaussian (r -> 0); both with
  EN/ES `.plot()` renderers. New "Data qualification" guide (EN/ES) under
  Calibration and uncertainty, linked from the GUM and levels guides, with
  three SVG figures; the API section "Uncertainty" is now "Uncertainty and
  data quality".
- B, D and AU frequency weightings in `WeightingFilter` / `weighting_filter`
  (`curve="B"|"D"|"AU"`), joining A/C/G/Z with the same 1 kHz normalization,
  `high_accuracy` oversampling, multichannel and stateful block processing.
  B follows ANSI S1.4-1983 Appendix C (the historical curve dropped from the
  IEC sound-level-meter standards); AU follows IEC 61012:1990 (the A
  weighting cascaded with the Table 2 U low-pass for measuring audible sound
  in the presence of ultrasound, designed toward an internal 288 kHz rate for
  the steep roll-off); D implements the withdrawn IEC 537:1976 aircraft-noise
  weighting from its published rational transfer function, cross-checked
  against SQAT (identical zeros/poles) and librosa (independent closed form,
  agreement within 0.002 dB) and pinned against the IEC 537 table republished
  in NASA CR-3406 (Table SLD-I).
- `verify_weighting_class` now also verifies `B` against ANSI S1.4-1983
  (Table IV design goals, Table V Type 1/2 tolerance masks) and `AU` against
  IEC 61012:1990 Table 1 (nominal A + nominal U with the separate-unit
  tolerances and the subclause 2.2 explicit AU values at 25/31.5/40 kHz),
  including the between-nominals sweep against the analytic design goals.
  The conformance report pins B against the strictest Type 0 mask, AU over
  the full 10 Hz-40 kHz Table 1 range at 96 kHz, and D against the published
  tabulated curve.
- `building.AirborneInsulationResult.report()` and
  `building.ImpactInsulationResult.report()` render the ISO 16283 field
  sound-insulation test report to a one-page PDF: the airborne fiche states
  the standardized level difference DnT (or, with `quantity="r_prime"`, the
  apparent sound reduction index R') per ISO 16283-1:2014 Clause 14 in the
  layout of the recommended Annex B results form, and the impact fiche the
  standardized L'nT (or normalized L'n) per ISO 16283-2:2020 Clause 14 /
  Annex C, each with the quantity tabulated to one decimal place beside the
  curve against the shifted reference (Clause 12), the boxed ISO 717-1 /
  ISO 717-2 field rating evaluated over the 16 core one-third-octave bands,
  the mandatory statement that the evaluation is based on field measurement
  results obtained by an engineering method, an optional requirement verdict
  and the shared metadata header/footer, localised in English and Spanish.
  `verbose=True` swaps the table for the per-band measurement chain (the
  energy-average room levels and the reverberation time beside the reported
  quantity); to support it, `airborne_insulation()` and `impact_insulation()`
  now retain their energy-averaged inputs on the results (`l1`, `l2`/`li`,
  `t2`, `t0`, all defaulting to `None` for backward-compatible construction).
- `metrology.spectrogram` and `metrology.SpectrogramResult`: a calibrated
  STFT power spectrogram (Bendat & Piersol, Random Data 4e, Section
  12.6.4.2) built on the exact segmentation and scaling of
  `power_spectral_density`, so a signal in pascals reads Pa²/Hz or Pa² per
  cell (a tone shows its mean square A²/2, i.e. its dB SPL, in every
  'spectrum' column), the column mean over time reproduces the Welch
  estimate bin by bin, and with a squared-COLA taper (Hann at 75 % overlap)
  the time-integrated 'density' power equals the record energy exactly. The
  result reports the time resolution T_B, the effective noise bandwidth Be,
  the hop, and the per-cell random error of the unaveraged estimate, and
  renders through `.plot()` (single-raster dB image, English and Spanish).
- `metrology.zoom_fft` and `metrology.ZoomFFTResult`: the zoom transform of
  Bendat & Piersol Section 11.5.4 (Eqs. 11.122-11.130) computed as its exact
  single-pass digital equivalent, the chirp-Z evaluation of the tapered
  record's DFT on the zoom grid, verified at machine precision against the
  book's demodulate-decimate-DFT chain. Amplitudes are calibrated per taper
  coherent gain (a sine of peak amplitude A on an analysis frequency reads
  amplitude A and power A²/2 exactly), and the result distinguishes the
  freely chosen `bin_spacing` from the record-and-taper-set
  `resolution_bandwidth`, with a `.plot()` renderer over the zoom band.
  Three conformance rows pin the tone calibration, the Parseval/COLA energy
  identity and the zoom demodulation chain; a new "Time-frequency analysis"
  guide (English and Spanish) documents both estimators.
- `metrology.tone_burst` and `metrology.ToneBurstResult` generate the gated
  sine burst of IEC 60268-1:1985 (Annex A, Clause A2): the tone starts at a
  zero crossing and lasts an integral number of full periods, as a single
  burst or as the repetitive train of Clause A2.2 with a stated repetition
  rate. The result carries the rectangular gating envelope and the exact
  sample bookkeeping (burst samples, onset, repetition period, duty cycle),
  a `.plot()` of the waveform with its envelope (EN/ES), and the closed-form
  gate energy `A^2 N/2` anchors the tests and a conformance row.
- `metrology.resample_signal` and `metrology.ResampledSignalResult` perform
  rational polyphase resampling behind an explicit anti-alias specification:
  the lowpass FIR is designed inside the function by the Kaiser window
  method from the stopband attenuation in dB (default 120) and the
  transition-band fraction of the smaller Nyquist frequency (default 0.05),
  and the designed taps travel with the result so the spec is verifiable
  against the filter itself. The tests measure the returned filter and
  assert the passband deviation and stopband leakage against the design's
  own ripple bound `10^(-A/20)`.
- `metrology.fractional_delay` delays a record by an arbitrary fractional
  number of samples via a frequency-domain phase ramp, with a `linear`
  boundary (zero-padded, bit-identical to the alignment kernel of
  `align_impulse_responses`, now shared) or a `circular` one (exact to
  machine precision on bin-centered tones: each component's phase changes
  by exactly `-2*pi*f*D/fs`).
- `metrology.window_metrics` and `metrology.WindowMetricsResult` compute the
  Harris (1978) figures of merit of any scipy window sampled DFT-even as the
  Welch estimators apply it: equivalent noise bandwidth (exactly 1, 3/2,
  1987/1458 and 1523/882 for rectangular/Hann/Hamming/Blackman), coherent
  gain, scalloping loss, worst-case processing loss, highest sidelobe level
  and the -3 dB main-lobe width, with a `.plot()` of the window and its
  spectrum (EN/ES) and an `enbw_hz()` bridge to the PSD estimator's
  resolution bandwidth.
- New "Test signals and sample-rate tools" guide (EN/ES) under Signals and
  spectra, a "Choosing the window" section in the spectral-analysis guide
  (EN/ES) with the window trade-off figure, and two documentation figures
  (`tone_burst_train`, `window_functions_tradeoff`).
- `metrology.cepstrum` brings cepstral analysis to the signal toolbox
  (Havelock, *Handbook of Signal Processing in Acoustics*, Chs. 27/87/75, and
  Bendat & Piersol Sec. 13.1.4): `cepstrum` computes the power, real or
  complex cepstrum over the quefrency axis (the complex kind unwraps the
  phase, removes and stores its linear component, and `CepstrumResult.invert`
  runs the homomorphic round trip back to the record); `lifter` splits a log
  spectrum into its smooth envelope and its fine structure with exactly
  complementary lowpass/highpass quefrency windows; and `echo_detection`
  reads a reflection's delay and coefficient off the power-cepstrum peak,
  whose height for an in-record echo is analytically the reflection
  coefficient itself (the n = 1 term of the ln(1 + a·e^(-j·theta)) series;
  the rahmonic amplitudes (-1)^(n+1)·a^n/n and the liftered-ripple extrema
  20·lg(1 ± a) dB are pinned as closed-form oracles in the tests and the
  conformance report). All three return frozen results with localised
  `.plot()` renderers. `minimum_phase` now folds its real cepstrum through
  the module's shared core; the refactor is verified bit-exact against the
  previous implementation on fixed responses.
- `metrology.envelope_spectrum` transforms the detected envelope itself,
  following the envelope-detector -> DC-remover chain of Bendat & Piersol
  Sec. 13.3 (Fig. 13.11) with either the Hilbert magnitude envelope or the
  book's square-law detector, scaled (window coherent-gain corrected) so a
  sinusoidal amplitude modulation reads out as a line at its exact
  amplitude: an AM tone (A0, m) puts A0·m at fm for the magnitude detector
  and 2·A0²·m at fm plus A0²·m²/2 at 2·fm for the squared one, the
  closed forms the tests and the conformance report pin. The frozen
  `EnvelopeSpectrumResult` keeps the removed mean level and offers a
  localised `.plot()` with the envelope and its spectrum.
- New "Cepstrum, echoes and the envelope spectrum" guide (English and
  Spanish) in the Signals and spectra section, with the echo-detection and
  envelope-spectrum figures.
- `electroacoustics.loudspeaker_characteristics` and
  `electroacoustics.LoudspeakerCharacteristics` gather the rated loudspeaker
  characteristics of IEC 60268-5:2003+A1:2007 around a measured on-axis
  response: the characteristic sensitivity level referred to 1 W into the rated
  impedance at 1 m (clauses 20.3/20.4) and the effective frequency range against
  the -10 dB band in the region of maximum sensitivity (clause 21.2) are
  computed from the response, alongside the rated impedance, rated frequency
  range, rated powers, resonance frequency, the impedance modulus curve, the
  total-harmonic-distortion curve and the directional/polar response. A
  `.report()` method renders the IEC 60268-5 rated-characteristics fiche: the
  rated-characteristics table beside the on-axis response with its tolerance
  band and effective-range markers, plus the impedance, THD and polar panels,
  the frequency and polar graphs drawn to the IEC 60263:1982 scale conventions
  (one frequency decade equal to 25 dB, and the 25 dB polar reference circle),
  localised in English and Spanish.
- `electroacoustics.microphone_characteristics` and
  `electroacoustics.MicrophoneCharacteristics` gather the rated microphone
  characteristics of IEC 60268-4:2014 around a measured free-field frequency
  response: the sensitivity level `20 lg(M / 1 V/Pa)` of the rated free-field
  sensitivity (clauses 11.1/11.3), the effective frequency range against the
  response tolerance limits (clause 12.2), the directivity index from a
  rotationally symmetric directional pattern through the clause 11.2.2 a)
  diffuse-field integral (clause 13.2.2) and the equivalent sound pressure
  level due to inherent noise from the weighted noise voltage over the rated
  sensitivity (clause 17.2) are computed from the standard's definitions,
  alongside the rated and minimum permitted load impedances (clauses
  10.2/10.3), the overload sound pressure level at a stated THD limit
  (clauses 14.2/15.2), the derived signal-to-noise ratio re 1 Pa and
  diffuse-field sensitivity level, and the rated power supply (clause 9.1). A
  `.report()` method renders the IEC 60268-4 rated-characteristics fiche: the
  rated-characteristics table beside the free-field response with its
  tolerance band, reference-frequency and effective-range markers, plus the
  directional-pattern, inherent-noise-spectrum and distortion-against-level
  panels, the frequency and polar graphs drawn to the IEC 60263:1982 scale
  conventions, localised in English and Spanish.
- `emission.NoiseEmissionDeclaration` and `emission.OperatingModeDeclaration`
  model the ISO 4871:1996 declaration of noise emission values of machinery and
  equipment: the dual-number form (a measured A-weighted sound power level
  `L_WA` and its uncertainty `K_WA`, optionally an emission sound pressure level
  `L_pA` at a work station) and the derived single-number value
  `L_WAd = L_WA + K_WA` (clause 3.15), with the single-machine verification
  verdict of clause 6.2 (`L_1 <= L_WAd`). `SoundPowerResult.declare()` builds a
  declaration straight from a measured sound power. A `.report()` method renders
  the ISO 4871 declaration fiche (the Annex B dual/single-number table across
  the operating-mode columns, the basic-standard and noise-test-code footnote
  and the verification table), localised in English and Spanish.
- `vibration.junction_transmission` implements the wave-approach bending-wave
  transmission coefficients for rigid plate junctions (Cremer et al. 1973;
  Craik 1981/1996; Hopkins 2007, Section 5.2.1.3). `junction_wave_parameters`
  returns the dimensionless wave parameters `chi` and `psi` of a plate pair
  (Eqs 5.10/5.11); `corner_transmission_coefficient` (Eq. 5.12) and
  `straight_transmission_coefficient` (Eq. 5.13) give the frequency-independent
  angle-resolved coefficients `tau12(theta)` (around a corner) and
  `tau13(theta)` (across a straight section) for X, T-junction (1)/(2) and L
  junctions, `inline_transmission_coefficient` gives the normal-incidence
  in-line coefficient (Eq. 5.14), and `angular_average_transmission_coefficient`
  integrates the diffuse-field average (Eq. 5.6). `coupling_loss_factor`
  (Eq. 2.154) and `wave_vibration_reduction_index` (Eq. 5.116) derive the SEA
  coupling loss factor and the wave-approach junction `Kij`. The
  `junction_transmission` builder returns a frozen `JunctionTransmissionResult`
  (corner and straight curves, their angular averages and a `corner_reduction_index`)
  with a `.plot()` of `tau` versus incidence angle.
- `environmental.impulsive_sound` implements the objective impulsive-sound
  prominence method of ISO/PAS 1996-3:2022. `impulsive_sound_adjustment` reads a
  calibrated pressure signal, computes the A-weighted, F time-weighted level
  history `LpAF`, detects onsets (gradient above 10 dB/s, merging events under
  50 ms apart), measures each onset's level difference and least-squares onset
  rate, and returns the governing prominence `P`, the adjustment `KI` and the
  clause 7 source category (not impulsive / regular impulsive / highly
  impulsive) plus the adjusted `LAeq`, in an `ImpulsiveSoundResult` with a
  `.plot()`. `sound_pressure_level_history` and `detect_onsets` expose the
  level-history and onset-analysis stages, the latter accepting an
  `"upper_half"` onset-rate variant for pass-bys.
- EASA ANP fleet database bridge in `phonometry.aircraft.anp_fleet`:
  `load_anp_database` reads the Aircraft Noise and Performance (ANP) CSV tables
  and exposes, for a real aircraft type and operation, its Noise-Power-Distance
  curves (`AnpNpdCurves`, `LAmax`/`SEL` versus distance per power setting) and
  its default fixed-point trajectory (`AnpProfile`, a ready Doc 29 flight path
  with the takeoff/landing ground-roll masks). `AnpDatabase`/`AnpAircraft` feed
  both straight into the existing `event_level`/`noise_contour` chain, so noise
  levels and contours can be computed from actual aircraft instead of only
  synthetic NPD input. Called without a path the loader uses the full EASA ANP
  database (archive version 2.3, 155 aircraft types) bundled with the package;
  pointed at a directory it reads any other ANP CSV export. Result objects
  expose `.plot()`.
- Every `.report()` fiche accepts a `language` argument (`'en'` default, `'es'`):
  Spanish strings and a comma decimal separator.
- The `.plot()` renderers of the building, noise-control and emission result
  objects accept a `language` keyword (`"en"` by default, or `"es"`). Spanish
  renders the axis labels, titles and legends with building-acoustics
  terminology and a comma decimal separator, while English stays exactly as
  before. A shared `phonometry._i18n` helper module backs the locale-aware
  number formatting and tick localisation.
- The `.plot()` methods of the aircraft, underwater and environmental result
  objects accept a `language` keyword (`"en"`, the default, or `"es"`). Spanish
  renders localised axis labels, titles and legends with comma decimal
  separators; English output is unchanged.
- The `.plot()` methods of the psychoacoustics, hearing and vibration results
  accept a `language` keyword (`"en"`, the default, or `"es"`). Spanish renders
  the axis labels, titles and legends in Spanish and switches the decimal
  separator to a comma; English output is unchanged.
- The `.plot()` methods of the metrology, electroacoustics, simulation and
  broadcast results accept a `language` keyword (`"en"`, the default, or
  `"es"`). Spanish renders localised axis labels, titles and legends and uses a
  comma decimal separator; English is unchanged. An unsupported language raises
  a clear `ValueError`.
- The room and materials `.plot()` renderers accept a `language` keyword
  (`"en"` default, `"es"` for Spanish). Passing `language="es"` renders the
  axis labels, titles and legends in Spanish and switches linear-axis tick
  decimals to a comma; the English output is unchanged. An unsupported code
  raises a clear `ValueError`.
- The frequency/band axes, the shifted-reference rating figure, the
  band-level bar chart, the façade x-axis, the ISO 717-2 500 Hz annotation
  and the time axis shared by every domain's `.plot()` renderers now
  localise their own axis labels and legend entries for `language="es"`
  ("Frequency [Hz]" to "Frecuencia [Hz]", "Measured" to "Medido", "Band" to
  "Banda", and so on), instead of leaving them in English whenever a domain
  renderer relied on the shared helper for that label. English output is
  unchanged.
- IEC 61260-1 filter class compliance can now be exported as a one-page PDF
  fiche. A new `filter_class_compliance(bank, *, num_points=..., edition=...)`
  runs the same verification as `verify_filter_class` and returns a frozen
  `FilterComplianceResult` that packages the verdict with the bank's
  second-order sections, mid-band frequencies, per-band decimation factors and
  sampling rate, so it can redraw the measured relative attenuation without
  keeping a reference to the (possibly stateful) bank. The result exposes the
  standard pair: `.plot()` draws the worst-margin band's measured relative
  attenuation over the class acceptance corridor (the pass region shaded green
  and any out-of-tolerance segment marked red), and `.report(path)` renders the
  accredited fiche laid out like an electroacoustic type-test report: a
  standard-basis line naming the IEC 61260 edition, a metadata header block, a
  per-band classification table (mid-band frequency, achieved class and binding
  margin) beside the mask-overlay plot, and the boxed `Class n - COMPLIES`
  result with its binding margin (or a non-compliance statement). `ReportMetadata`
  gains an optional `required_class` field (0, 1 or 2); when supplied, the fiche
  adds a PASS/FAIL verdict row that passes when the achieved overall class is at
  least as strict as the required one. `verify_filter_class` keeps its existing
  dictionary return unchanged. Selecting `edition="1995"` verifies against the
  IEC 61260:1995 / ANSI S1.11-2004 mask, which keeps the stricter class 0 that
  the 2014 edition dropped, so a high-order bank can be certified to class 0.
  Two rendered example fiches (2014-edition class 1 and 1995-edition class 0)
  are kept under `.github/reports/`, regenerated with `make reports`
  (`scripts/generate_reports.py`), and linked from the filter-banks guide.
- ISO 717 sound-insulation ratings can now be exported as a one-page PDF fiche
  through a `report(path)` method, laid out like an accredited-laboratory test
  report: a standard-basis line, a metadata header block, the one-third-octave
  table beside the measured-versus-shifted-reference plot, a boxed single-number
  result and a footer with a fixed disclaimer. `WeightedRatingResult.report()`
  renders the airborne ISO 717-1 fiche (the `Rw (C; Ctr)` result), and
  `ImpactRatingResult.report()` renders the impact ISO 717-2 counterpart with
  the `Ln,w (CI)` result and the opposite deviation sign.
  `SoundReductionResult.report()` is a convenience that rates the predicted
  `R(f)` and writes its fiche in one call. The report metadata is supplied as a
  new `ReportMetadata` frozen dataclass (specimen, client, room and climatic
  conditions, laboratory identity and an optional requirement); every field is
  optional and only the supplied ones are rendered, so the same object drives a
  full accredited fiche or, with `metadata=None`, a lightweight prediction
  fiche. When a requirement is given, the fiche adds a PASS/FAIL verdict row
  (airborne passes at or above the target, impact at or below it). Passing
  `verbose=True` swaps the two-column `f | value` table for the ISO 717 Annex C
  columns (frequency, measured value, shifted reference, unfavourable
  deviation). Rendering uses reportlab, added as the optional
  `phonometry[report]` extra so it stays out of the runtime dependencies; a
  missing reportlab raises a clear `ImportError` with the install command,
  mirroring the matplotlib guard behind `.plot()`. The rating results gain a
  `quantity` field ("airborne" or "impact") that selects the report labels and
  standard reference. Rendered example fiches (airborne and impact) are kept
  under `.github/reports/`, regenerated with `make reports`
  (`scripts/generate_reports.py`), and linked from the documentation.
- ISO 11654 weighted sound absorption ratings can now be exported as a one-page
  PDF fiche through `AbsorptionRatingResult.report(path)`, laid out like an
  accredited ISO 354 absorption certificate: a standard-basis line, a metadata
  header, the octave-band practical-coefficient table beside the
  practical-versus-shifted-reference plot, the boxed `alpha_w` result with its
  shape indicator and absorption class, an optional minimum-`alpha_w` verdict
  and the fixed disclaimer. A new `weighted_absorption_from_third_octave`
  convenience rates the one-third-octave `alpha_s` spectrum and retains it on
  the result, so the fiche can also show the full one-third-octave `alpha_s`
  table (`Frequency | alpha_s | alpha_p`) that accredited certificates carry.
  It reuses the shared `ReportMetadata` and reportlab back end of the ISO 717
  fiche.
- ISO 532-1 Zwicker loudness results can now be exported as a one-page PDF fiche
  through `ZwickerLoudness.report(path)`: a standard-basis line, a metadata
  header, a compact metrics table (total loudness `N`, loudness level `LN`, and
  the `N5`/`N10` percentiles for a time-varying result) beside the
  specific-loudness pattern plot, the boxed `N (LN)` result, an optional
  maximum-loudness verdict and the fixed disclaimer.
- Programme-loudness measurements can now be exported as a one-page EBU R128
  compliance fiche through `ProgramLoudnessResult.report(path)`: a standard-basis
  line (EBU R128 / ITU-R BS.1770-5), a metadata header, a compliance table
  (integrated loudness, loudness range, maximum true peak, and the maximum
  momentary/short-term levels, each with its target/limit and a PASS/FAIL or
  informational result), the loudness-versus-time plot, the boxed integrated
  result, a combined verdict (integrated within the target tolerance and true
  peak at or below -1 dBTP) and a measurement-basis strip. The verdict is driven
  only by the integrated loudness and the true peak; loudness range and the
  momentary/short-term maxima are shown as informational characterising
  measures. `ReportMetadata.requirement` now accepts any finite value, since a
  programme-loudness target in LUFS is negative.
- Aircraft-noise EPNL results can now be exported as a one-page ICAO Annex 16
  certification fiche through `EPNLResult.report(path)`: a standard-basis line
  (ICAO Annex 16 Vol. I Appendix 2), a TCDSN-style metadata header (aircraft,
  manufacturer / type-certificate holder, applicant, measurement point), a
  metrics table of the informational intermediate quantities (the peak `PNLTM`,
  the duration correction `D`, the 10 dB-down record window and, when non-zero,
  the bandsharing adjustment) above the result's own landscape
  `PNLT`-versus-time plot, the boxed `EPNL = X EPNdB` result, a
  Level | Limit | Margin verdict row when a certification limit is supplied
  (the EPNL passes at or below it), a static reference-conditions strip and a
  footer noting the result is computational and not an official State noise
  certificate. It reuses the shared `ReportMetadata` and reportlab back end of
  the other fiches, and does not reproduce any type-certificate data sheet. A
  rendered example fiche is kept under `.github/reports/`, regenerated with
  `make reports`, and linked from the documentation.
- `enclosure_insertion_loss` now accepts a panel prediction result directly for
  its `panel_transmission_loss` argument, in addition to a per-band array or a
  callable. A `SoundReductionResult` or `ApertureTransmissionResult` (from the
  panel and aperture models) is matched structurally, so its per-band `R` and
  band centres feed the enclosure calculation without any dependency of
  `noise_control` on `building`. The predicted panel `R` and a measured `R`
  are therefore interchangeable at the enclosure input.
- Atmospheric refraction: ray tracing and the parabolic equation
  (`phonometry.environmental.atmospheric_refraction`, also re-exported at the
  top level). The module is the refracting-atmosphere counterpart of the ocean
  solvers in `phonometry.underwater.numerical_propagation` and is clean-room
  from Salomons, *Computational Atmospheric Acoustics* (2001) and Attenborough
  & Van Renterghem, *Predicting Outdoor Sound* 2e (2021, Ch. 11). Vertical
  gradients of the effective sound speed `c_eff(z) = c(z) + wind` are built with
  `linear_sound_speed_profile` and `log_linear_sound_speed_profile` (Salomons
  Eq. (4.5)). `atmospheric_ray_paths` integrates Snell's law for sound rays
  (Eq. (4.3)) with a fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme, reflecting at the ground,
  and returns the curved ray paths, turning points, travel times and ground
  reflections; for a linear gradient every ray is an exact circular arc of
  radius `ray_curvature_radius` and an upward-refracting profile has the
  closed-form `shadow_zone_distance`. `atmospheric_parabolic_equation` solves
  the Green's Function Parabolic Equation (GFPE, Salomons Appendix H) with the
  split-step Fourier algorithm, a Gaussian starter (Eq. (G.64)), a
  finite-impedance ground condition (Eq. (H.28)) and an absorbing top layer, and
  returns the relative sound level (dB re free field) over the range-height
  plane. In a homogeneous atmosphere the GFPE reproduces the exact
  spherical-wave ground effect (`ground_effect`) to about 0.1 dB; it is
  reciprocal and, over an upward-refracting profile, resolves the acoustic
  shadow. Ground impedance is taken directly, from a `PorousMediumResult`, or
  from an effective flow resistivity via the porous models of
  `phonometry.materials`. The results expose `.plot()` (the profile, the ray
  paths and the relative-level field).
- Theoretical panel sound insulation, predicting the airborne sound reduction
  index `R(f)` from physical properties (`phonometry.building.panel_transmission`
  and `phonometry.building.aperture_transmission`, re-exported at the top level).
  `single_panel_transmission_loss` implements the mass law and coincidence dip by
  Sharp's method (Bies, Hansen & Howard 2017, *Engineering Noise Control* 5e,
  Section 7.2.4): the field-incidence mass law `TL = 10 lg(1 + (pi f m''/rho0 c0)^2)
  - 5.5` (rising 6 dB per octave and 6 dB per doubling of mass), the closed-form
  coincidence frequency `fc = (c0^2/2pi) sqrt(m''/B')`, and the loss-factor-
  controlled dip. `double_wall_transmission_loss` adds the mass-spring-mass
  double wall (Section 7.2.6): the resonance `f0 = 60 sqrt((m1+m2)/(m1 m2 d))`,
  the total-mass law below it and the cavity-boosted sum above, with an optional
  porous `cavity_medium` (a `materials.PorousMediumResult`) that lowers `f0`.
  `slit_transmission_coefficient`, `circular_aperture_transmission_coefficient`
  and `composite_transmission_loss` predict transmission through slits (Gomperts)
  and holes (Wilson & Soroka) and combine them with the wall in the area-weighted
  energy sum (Hopkins 2007, *Sound insulation*, Section 4.3.10, Eq. 4.92), so a
  bare opening of relative area `Sa/S` caps the result at `10 lg(S/Sa)`. Every
  prediction returns a `SoundReductionResult` / `ApertureTransmissionResult` with
  `.rating()` (ISO 717-1) and `.plot()`, and is clean-room from the cited books.
- Plate radiation efficiency and theoretical point mobilities
  (`phonometry.vibration.radiation_efficiency` and
  `phonometry.vibration.point_mobility`, also re-exported at the top level).
  `radiation_efficiency` predicts the frequency-averaged radiation efficiency
  `sigma(f)` of a bending plate by Leppington/Maidanik "method no. 1" (Hopkins
  2007, Section 2.9.4, Eqs 2.227-2.230), tending to `(1 - fc/f)^-0.5` above the
  coincidence frequency `coincidence_frequency`, so it supplies the ISO 7849
  radiation factor of `sound_power_from_vibration` without a power measurement.
  `infinite_plate_impedance` / `infinite_beam_mobility` (and the rod, moment and
  bundled-`MobilityResult` variants) give the closed-form point impedances and
  mobilities of infinite structures and the injected power
  `W = 0.5 |F|^2 Re{Y}` (Cremer, Heckl & Petersson 2005, *Structure-Borne Sound*
  3e, Table 5.1), the theoretical companions of the measured ISO 7626 mobilities.
- Industrial noise control: silencers, HVAC and machine enclosures, a new
  `phonometry.noise_control` domain (Bies, Hansen & Howard, *Engineering Noise
  Control* 5th ed.; Munjal, *Acoustics of Ducts and Mufflers*). `expansion_chamber`,
  `helmholtz_resonator`, `quarter_wave_resonator` and `extended_tube_chamber`
  build **reactive silencers** by the one-dimensional four-pole
  (transmission-matrix) method, returning a `ReactiveSilencerResult` with the
  transmission loss, the insertion loss for configurable source/radiation
  impedances, the compound transfer matrix and `.plot()`; the expansion-chamber
  transmission loss matches the closed form `10 lg[1 + (1/4)(m - 1/m)^2 sin^2 kL]`
  (Bies Eq. (8.111)) exactly, and the four-pole machinery is available under
  `phonometry.noise_control` (`duct_matrix`, `shunt_matrix`, `cascade`,
  `transmission_loss`, `insertion_loss`, `helmholtz_impedance`,
  `quarter_wave_impedance`). The
  `noise_control.hvac` module adds the duct end reflection (`end_reflection_loss`,
  ASHRAE Table 8.14), bend insertion loss (`elbow_insertion_loss`, Table 8.11),
  the plenum transmission loss by Wells' method (`plenum_attenuation`) and the
  flow-generated (self) noise of straight ducts and mitred bends
  (`flow_noise_straight_duct`, `flow_noise_bend`, VDI 2081). `enclosure_insertion_loss`
  gives the machine-enclosure insertion loss `IL = R - C` (Bies Eqs. (7.103),
  (7.111)) from a **caller-supplied** panel transmission loss `R` (array or
  callable; never predicted here) and the interior room constant reused from
  `phonometry.room.room_constant`. The four-pole expansion chamber is
  cross-checked against the independent 2D FDTD solver.
- Radiation of a rigid circular piston in an infinite baffle
  (`phonometry.electroacoustics.piston`, re-exported at the top level). `radiating_piston`
  computes the radiation impedance `rho c S (R1 + j X1)` from the piston
  resistance `R1 = 1 - 2 J1(2ka)/2ka` and reactance `X1 = 2 H1(2ka)/2ka`
  (Beranek & Mellow, *Acoustics* 2nd ed., Eqs. (13.117), (13.118)), the
  low-frequency radiation mass `8 rho a^3 / 3` (Eq. (4.151)), the far-field
  directivity `2 J1(ka sin theta)/(ka sin theta)` and the directivity index,
  returning a `RadiatingPistonResult` with `.plot()`; the building blocks
  `piston_resistance`, `piston_reactance` and `piston_directivity` are exposed
  directly.
- Objective speech intelligibility STOI and ESTOI
  (`phonometry.hearing.objective_intelligibility.stoi`, also `phonometry.stoi`).
  `stoi(clean, degraded, fs)` computes the short-time objective intelligibility
  (Taal, Hendriks, Heusdens & Jensen 2011, *An Algorithm for Intelligibility
  Prediction of Time-Frequency Weighted Noisy Speech*, IEEE TASLP 19(7); short
  version Taal et al. 2010, ICASSP): both signals are resampled to 10 kHz, split
  into 256-sample Hann frames at 50 % overlap, cleared of the clean frames more
  than 40 dB below the loudest, grouped into 15 one-third-octave bands from
  150 Hz, and compared over 384 ms segments by a per-band envelope correlation
  after a per-segment normalisation and a `-15` dB signal-to-distortion
  clipping. With `extended=True` it computes ESTOI (Jensen & Taal 2016, IEEE/ACM
  TASLP 24(11)), which mean- and variance-normalises the short-time spectrogram
  over both its rows and columns so the intermediate index is a spectral
  correlation that tracks modulated maskers. The measures return a `STOIResult`
  with the index `value`, the per-segment and (for STOI) per-band intermediate
  scores, and a `.plot()`. The implementation is clean-room from the papers and
  matches `pystoi` (a test-only cross-check, never a runtime dependency) to well
  under `1e-3`.
- AES17-2015 noise measurements for audio equipment
  (`phonometry.electroacoustics.dynamic_range` and `idle_channel_noise`, also
  re-exported at the top level). `dynamic_range` implements clause 6.4.1 (a
  997 Hz, -60 dBFS test tone, the standard notch, and the CCIR-RMS weighting of
  5.2.7, expressed as the ratio of the full-scale sine to the weighted residual)
  and `idle_channel_noise` implements clause 6.4.2 (the CCIR-RMS-weighted output
  with the device idle, in dBFS). Both reuse the standard notch and the ITU-R
  BS.468-4 weighting of the existing THD+N chain; the CCIR-RMS filter is that
  curve with the standard `-5.63` dB offset (unity at 2 kHz).
- Image-source room impulse response and the steady-state room field
  (`phonometry.room.image_source` and `phonometry.room.steady_field`).
  `image_source_rir` synthesises the room impulse response of a rectangular
  room by mirroring the source in its walls (Kuttruff *Room Acoustics* 4.1,
  Equations (4.4)-(4.6); Vorländer *Auralization* 11.4; Allen & Berkley 1979):
  the direct sound plus one delayed, attenuated impulse per image, with the
  `1/(4 pi r)` spreading, the wall pressure reflection factors `R = sqrt(1 -
  alpha)` (Vorländer Equation (11.39)) raised to the per-wall reflection counts,
  and an optional per-band air attenuation `exp(-m r / 2)`. It returns broadband
  or per-octave-band RIRs plus an exact sub-sample reflection table (times,
  distances, orders, amplitudes, image positions) and a `.plot()` reflectogram;
  `audible_image_count` and `reflection_density` give the shoebox image count
  (Equation (9.23)) and the temporal density `4 pi c^3 t^2 / V` (Equation
  (4.6)). `steady_state_field` and its parts `room_constant`,
  `critical_distance`, `schroeder_frequency` and `steady_state_spl` predict the
  steady-state level `Lp = Lw + 10 lg(Q/(4 pi r^2) + 4/R)` with the room
  constant `R = S alpha/(1 - alpha)`, the critical distance and the Schroeder
  frequency `2000 sqrt(T/V)` (Bies *Engineering Noise Control* 6.4, Equations
  (6.43)-(6.44); Kuttruff 5.6 and Equations (3.44), (5.44)). Anchored by the
  exact reflection geometry, the audible-image count, the Eyring reverberation
  time recovered from the synthetic decay (near-cubic limit) and an independent
  2D FDTD cross-check of the rigid-wall echo and the uniform-damping T60, plus
  the closed-form steady-field relations, with a new EN/ES guide and GitHub
  theory page.
- Spherical-wave ground effect and advanced barrier diffraction
  (`phonometry.environmental.ground_barriers`). `ground_effect` predicts the
  excess attenuation over a finite-impedance ground from the Weyl-Van der Pol
  spherical-wave reflection coefficient `Q = Rp + (1 - Rp) F(w)` (Attenborough
  & Van Renterghem 2021 Eq. 2.40; Salomons 2001 Eqs. D.57-D.60), with the
  boundary-loss factor through the scaled complementary error function
  (`scipy.special.wofz`) and the ground impedance taken either directly or from
  the Delany-Bazley / Miki porous models of `phonometry.materials`.
  `barrier_insertion_loss` adds wave-theoretic screening beyond the ISO 9613-2
  `Dz` term: the Kurze-Anderson closed form in the Fresnel number (Bies 2017
  Eq. 5.138), the exact rigid half-plane (the flat-wedge limit of the MacDonald
  / Hadden & Pierce solution, Attenborough Eqs. 9.19-9.20), thick barriers by
  double-edge diffraction (Bies Eq. 5.157) and the coherent four-path barrier
  on the ground combining the source/receiver images with the spherical-wave
  `Q`. Both results expose `.plot()` (excess attenuation and insertion loss vs
  frequency). Anchored by the analytic limits (hard ground `Q -> 1` and the
  `+6 dB` enhancement, grazing `Rp -> -1`, Kurze-Anderson `5 dB` at `N = 0`,
  the exact half-plane `6 dB` at the shadow boundary) as tests and conformance
  checks, with a new EN/ES guide and GitHub theory page.
- Docs site: unified per-page references. Guides can declare a typed
  bibliography in the page frontmatter (standard, book, article, web and
  report entries with DOI and publisher-catalogue links) and the site renders
  one localized, alphabetized APA-7 "References" section at the end of the
  article, wired into the "On this page" panel. After the loudness, aircraft
  noise and psychoacoustic annoyance pilots, every remaining guide and the
  five theory chapters (EN + ES) migrated their manual References and
  Standards sections into the typed bibliography, with a verified
  publisher-catalogue URL or DOI for every entry.
- Docs site: accessible animation embed (`Video.astro`). Wraps the existing
  four-variant WebM convention (EN/ES, light/dark, lazy poster) and adds a
  required accessible name and textual description, a visible localized
  download link, an in-element textual fallback and keyboard-operable
  controls. Every guide animation now embeds through it, each with a real
  textual description of what the clip shows.
- Docs site: theme-aware figure embed (`ThemeImage.astro`). Takes the light
  variant URL and one alt text, derives the `_dark` twin and emits the same
  light-only/dark-only pair the theme switch and the responsive width tiers
  key on, with native lazy-loading (the page hero opts into eager). All
  guide, getting-started and why-phonometry figure pairs (EN + ES) embed
  through it, and the pages became MDX along the way.
- Docs: media placement pass from the documentation audit. Thirty-eight
  figure, animation and code-block moves reunite each medium with the prose,
  formula or snippet that explains it (including the whole inverted
  underwater-propagation layout and a leftover duplicated code block in the
  levels guide), applied in lockstep to the GitHub docs and both site
  languages, with new introductory sentences where a clip had none.
- Correlation, time-delay estimation and Hilbert envelope (Bendat & Piersol,
  Random Data 4e; Knapp & Carter 1976): `correlation` (auto/cross via
  zero-padded FFT with the biased, unbiased and coefficient normalizations,
  the coefficient always carried, and the per-lag random error of
  Eqs. 8.109/8.112 as `.random_error()` / `correlation_random_error`),
  `time_delay` (the direct correlator of Section 5.1.4, the Eq. 5.101b
  cross-spectrum phase slope and the generalized cross-correlation with the
  Knapp & Carter Table I weightings Roth/SCOT/PHAT/ML over the shared Welch
  core, sub-sample peak refinement by parabolic interpolation with optional
  band-limited local upsampling, and the Eq. 8.129 peak-location uncertainty
  with its Eq. 8.130 interval), `impulse_response_delay` and
  `align_impulse_responses` (sub-sample IR arrival/pair delay and exact
  fractional-shift alignment) and `envelope` (analytic-signal envelope,
  unwrapped instantaneous phase and frequency per Chapter 13, with optional
  anti-aliased or ECMA-convention plain decimation), each returning a frozen
  result with `.plot()`. Anchored on exact integer and synthetic fractional
  delays (accuracy pinned from a few hundredths of a sample for the
  parabola alone to 1e-5 at 32x upsampling), the closed-form sine and
  bandwidth-limited-white
  autocorrelations, the Example 8.5 published numbers, the ideal-delta
  GCC-PHAT of a noiseless delay and the exact AM envelope; seven new
  conformance checks.
- Swept-sine harmonic-distortion separation (Farina 2000; Novak, Lotton &
  Simon 2015): `synchronized_sweep_signal` (the synchronized exponential
  sweep of Novak Eqs. 47/49, whose rounded rate makes a `L*ln(n)` time
  shift exactly equivalent to the nth harmonic) and `swept_sine_distortion`
  in `phonometry.electroacoustics`, which deconvolves a recorded sweep
  response (closed-form analytic inverse spectrum for the synchronized
  sweep, extending every harmonic band to `[n*f1, n*f2]`; the classical
  Farina inverse filter for plain ESS recordings) and windows each
  distortion order at its exact `L*ln(n)` advance with sub-sample
  alignment, returning a frozen `SweptSineDistortionResult` with the
  harmonic frequency responses `H1..HN`, their impulse responses, THD as a
  function of the excitation frequency, per-order distortion ratios and
  `.plot()`. With the synchronized sweep the harmonic phases are system
  properties; with `method="farina"` the magnitudes are exact and the
  phases are documented as excitation-dependent. Anchored on the Chebyshev
  identities of a memoryless cubic polynomial (`|H1| = 1+3a3/4`,
  `|H2| = a2/2` at phase -pi/2, `|H3| = a3/4` at phase pi, and the
  closed-form THD), the pure-linear THD floor, a delayed/gained Hammerstein
  composition, and agreement with the tone-by-tone `thd` analyzer on the
  same nonlinearity.
- Phase utilities in `phonometry.metrology` (Bendat & Piersol Sec. 13.1.4):
  `minimum_phase` (the minimum-phase response of a magnitude via the real
  cepstrum, with trigonometric-interpolation oversampling against cepstral
  aliasing and documented sampling/zero-floor precautions), `group_delay`
  (central-difference `-(1/2pi) dphi/df` of an unwrapped one-sided
  response), `excess_phase` (measured minus minimum phase: the all-pass
  part no stable causal equalizer can remove) and `phase_decomposition`
  (frozen result bundling magnitude, the three phases and the total and
  excess group delays, with `.plot()`). Anchored on a strictly
  minimum-phase biquad reconstructed to better than 1e-12 rad, the exact
  first-order-allpass group delay `(1-a^2)/(1+2a*cos(w)+a^2)`, and the
  exact `-2*pi*f*t0` excess phase and constant excess group delay of a
  pure fractional latency. Seven new conformance checks across both
  features (306 total).
- 2D FDTD wave simulation as a public API (new `phonometry.simulation`
  domain, promoting the engine behind the documentation animations):
  `fdtd_simulation` (deterministic staggered-grid pressure-velocity leapfrog
  solver per Attenborough & Van Renterghem 2021 chapter 4, Eqs. 4.11-4.14,
  returning a frozen `FDTDResult` with per-probe pressure histories, optional
  field snapshots and `.plot()` for probe traces and field frames), the
  stepping engine `FDTD2D` (now with rasterised rigid `obstacle_mask`
  geometry and per-side locally reacting real-impedance boundaries,
  Eqs. 4.32-4.35, alongside the existing sponge layers), and the sources
  `GaussianPulse`, `CWSource` and the new arbitrary-waveform `SignalSource`.
  Validated against analytic oracles: rigid-box and 1D-tube
  eigenfrequencies, free-field arrival delay and cylindrical `1/sqrt(r)`
  decay, the rigid-wall image echo, the normal-incidence impedance
  reflection coefficient `(Z - rho c)/(Z + rho c)`, the scheme's discrete
  dispersion relation and second-order convergence under grid refinement;
  two new conformance checks. The figure/animation scripts now import the
  library engine (bit-identical fields, committed clips unchanged).
- Porous-material models and multilayer absorber prediction
  (`phonometry.materials.porous_absorber`): the Delany-Bazley one-parameter
  power law (with the Bies Table D.1 presets for polyester and foams and
  the published 0.01 < X < 1 fit-range warning), Miki's positive-real
  revision and the five-parameter Johnson-Champoux-Allard model, each
  returning a frozen `PorousMediumResult` (characteristic impedance,
  wavenumber, effective density/bulk modulus, `.plot()`); a declarative
  transfer-matrix multilayer solver (`layered_absorber`) over porous, air,
  perforated-plate, microperforated-plate (Maa's exact Bessel impedance
  with the Eq. 5 end corrections) and limp-membrane layers at any incidence
  angle with rigid/free/impedance terminations, evaluated through a
  numerically robust admittance recursion and exposing the reciprocal chain
  matrix; the random-incidence Paris integral
  (`diffuse_field_absorption`) and the locally reacting closed form
  (`statistical_absorption`, maximum 0.951); and the closed-form
  Helmholtz/membrane resonance helpers. Anchored digit-exact on the printed
  coefficient tables (Bies 5e Table D.1 / Mechel 2e G.11; Miki 1990
  Eqs. 30-34), on the Johnson et al. 1987 asymptotic limits, on the
  hard-backed-layer and lossless-cavity closed forms, on Maa 1998 (the
  Eq. 4 approximation, Eq. 9/23 absorption identities, Eq. 11 resonance,
  Table I and the Fig. 5 design example) and cross-checked against the
  ASTM E2611 `TransferMatrix` machinery; ten new conformance checks. Three
  source misprints recorded in the errata registry (Maa 1998 Eq. 5b;
  Attenborough & Van Renterghem 2021 Table 5.1 and Eq. 5.13).
- Programme loudness and true peak (ITU-R BS.1770-5, EBU R 128 with Tech
  3341/3342), a new `phonometry.broadcast` domain: `program_loudness` (the
  full EBU Mode measurement set as a frozen `ProgramLoudnessResult` with
  `.plot()`: integrated loudness with the two-stage -70 LKFS / -10 LU gate,
  ungated momentary and short-term series with their maxima, the Tech 3342
  loudness range with its cascaded -20 LU gate and 10th-95th percentile
  spread, and per-channel true peaks), `integrated_loudness`,
  `loudness_range`, `true_peak_level` (Annex 2 oversampling to 192 kHz,
  sharing the inter-sample-peak machinery of `lc_peak`), `k_weighting` /
  `k_weighting_coefficients` (the Annex 1 biquads, verbatim at 48 kHz and
  redesigned through the analog prototype elsewhere, response within
  0.02 dB at 32 kHz and above) and `channel_weight` (the Annex 3 position-dependent weights,
  Table 4). Validated against every synthesizable EBU Tech 3341 minimum
  requirements signal (cases 1-6 and 9-23) and Tech 3342 LRA signal (cases
  1-4) at their official tolerances, the 997 Hz / -3.01 LKFS anchor and the
  Annex 2 under-read bound; eight new conformance checks and a new
  programme-loudness guide (EN/ES) with a metering figure.
- Calibrated spectral analysis (Bendat & Piersol, Random Data 4e):
  `power_spectral_density` and `cross_spectral_density` (Welch estimators
  that report the effective number of independent averages under overlap,
  the normalized random errors of Eqs. 8.158/9.33/9.52 and the chi-square
  confidence interval of Eq. 8.163), `coherent_output_spectrum` (the
  Gvv = γ²·Gyy / Gnn split with the spectral SNR and the Eq. 9.73 random
  error), `resolution_bias_error` (the Eq. 8.141 first-order peak bias),
  `fractional_octave_smoothing` (constant-power 1/n-octave kernel, exact
  flat-spectrum invariance) and `noise_signal` (seeded white/pink/red/blue/
  violet noise with an exact power-law PSD slope), each estimator returning
  a frozen result with `.plot()`. The random errors and interval coverage
  are pinned by seeded Monte Carlo against the closed forms, and the
  slopes/levels by exact oracles; six new conformance checks.
- The `transfer_function`/`coherence` estimators, the p-p `sound_intensity`
  probe and the ECMA-418-1 tonality spectrum now compute their spectra
  through the shared Welch core in `phonometry.metrology.spectra`
  (bit-identical outputs, verified array-for-array against the previous
  implementations).
- Rotorcraft terrain and screening (NORAH2 guidance §A.4.4-A.4.5, completing
  the ECAC Doc 32 domain): `mean_ground_plane` (the closed-form continuous
  least-squares plane of a terrain section, Eq. 36-40, with orthogonal
  equivalent heights), `mean_flow_resistivity` (the log-mean of Eq. 41),
  `diffraction_attenuation` (Eq. 42-44 with the multiple-edge coefficient and
  the 25 dB bound) and `terrain_screening_adjustment` (the full vertical
  section: mean-plane ground effect on clear paths, rubber-band diffraction
  combined with side ground effects per Eq. 45-47 when terrain blocks the
  line of sight), plus digital-elevation-model support in
  `rotorcraft_event_level`/`rotorcraft_noise_contour` (`terrain`,
  `terrain_resolution`) and per-receiver `flow_resistivity`/`ground_elevation`
  arrays on the contour grid. Anchored on closed-form oracles (flat and
  inclined sections reproduce the flat-ground model exactly, hand-checked
  rubber-band geometry, classical grazing 10·lg 3) and end to end on the
  NORAH2 ARP Case 3 per-receiver elevations (187 microphones, SEL/LASmax to
  0.05 dB) and the mixed-ground Case 2 grid in a single call; four new
  conformance checks. Two further guidance defects recorded in the errata
  registry (the Eq. 46 subscript and the §A.4.5 cross-references).
- Rotorcraft single-event method (ECAC Doc 32 §4.3/§5-6, NORAH2 guidance
  §A.3-A.5) completing the hemisphere chain:
  `flight_condition_weights`/`interpolated_source_level` (the distance-scaled
  Delaunay interpolation across a hemisphere database, Eq. 3-10, with nearest
  neighbour outside the envelope and optional database lookup triangulations),
  `flight_path_kinematics` (ground speed, airspeed, heading, curvature, bank
  and path angle by central differences, Eq. 16-21), `rotorcraft_event_level`
  (the received one-third-octave time history at recorded time and its
  `LASmax`, full-history and 10 dB-down `SEL` and ICAO Annex 16 `EPNL`, with
  per-point overrides for radar-track workflows, bank-tilted emission frames
  and per-point class-substitution level offsets) and `rotorcraft_noise_contour`
  (vectorised single-event `SEL`/`LASmax` ground grids), each result frozen
  with `.plot()`. `RotorcraftHemisphere.mirrored()` handles mirrored-rotor
  class substitutions (Eq. 2). Validated end to end against the NORAH2
  reference implementation's ARP verification cases (emission angles 0.01°,
  hard-ground step levels 0.08 dB(A) out to 18 km, `LASmax` 0.03 dB, `SEL`
  0.05-0.4 dB, `PNLTM` 0.1 dB, 187-microphone contour grid 0.7 dB worst case) and against
  hand-checked interpolation, kinematics and Lorentzian-flyover closed forms;
  four new conformance checks. Two guidance defects recorded in the errata
  registry (Eq. 21 path angle; §A.3.1 triangulation plane).
- Four new physics-based 2D FDTD documentation animations (WebM + poster
  for the site, GIF for the GitHub docs, EN + ES, light + dark), each
  simulated with `scripts/fdtd2d.py` and annotated on canvas:
  `anim_fdtd_barrier` (a thin rigid screen on reflecting ground driven at
  100 Hz vs 500 Hz side by side, with the measured insertion loss at a
  shadow-zone receiver, embedded in the outdoor-propagation guide),
  `anim_fdtd_ground_effect` (a 400 Hz source over a rigid plane forming
  the direct + image-source interference lobes, with the level on an 8 m
  arc converging to the two-path model and its predicted nulls, embedded
  in the outdoor-propagation and aircraft-noise guides),
  `anim_fdtd_ducting` (a low-frequency pulse trapped by a SOFAR-like
  sound-speed channel vs a near-surface source that leaks to depth, with
  the c(z) profile inset, embedded in the underwater-propagation guide)
  and `anim_fdtd_diffusion` (a plane wavefront onto a flat panel vs an
  N = 7 quadratic-residue Schroeder diffuser, with the scattered field
  and the ISO 17497-2 arc diffusion coefficients, embedded in the
  surface-scattering guide).
- Seven new mechanism animations (WebM + poster for the site, GIF for the
  GitHub docs, EN + ES, light + dark): the ISO 10534-2 standing wave in the
  impedance tube (rigid vs porous termination), the EN 12354-1 flanking
  paths Dd/Ff/Fd/Df, the ISO 9614-2 intensity scan accumulating partial
  powers into L_W, the ISO 18233 sweep deconvolution into the impulse
  response, the ISO 532-1 specific-loudness pattern and its integral, the
  same source measured in an anechoic and a reverberation room converging
  to one L_W, and comb filtering from a single floor reflection; embedded
  in the materials, insulation-prediction, sound-power, intensity,
  room-acoustics and loudness guides (EN + ES) with deferred loading, plus
  a `--anim NAME` flag on `scripts/generate_graphs.py` to re-render a
  single clip.
- `scripts/fdtd2d.py`: a small deterministic 2D acoustic FDTD engine
  (staggered-grid pressure-velocity leapfrog, heterogeneous c/rho maps,
  rigid walls, sponge absorbing layers, Gaussian-pulse and CW sources,
  frame subsampling for animation rendering) with physics and determinism
  tests, backing the physics-based documentation animations.
- `anim_fdtd_room_modes`: a 2D FDTD documentation clip driving a rigid
  5 m × 3,5 m room on its (2,1) mode and between modes, showing the
  standing-wave pattern and the RMS mode map growing to dominance on
  resonance while the off-mode response stays weak and disorganised;
  embedded in the room-acoustics and reverberation-prediction guides
  (EN + ES).
- Clause 5.3.8 Step 3 inside `analyze_spectrum` (DIN 45681 / ISO PAS 20065):
  audible tones sharing a critical band are energy-summed (Formula (17),
  shared lines counted once) into a combined FG entry rated at the most
  audible member, with the exactly-two-tones-below-1000-Hz separation
  exception (Formulae (18)/(19)); the new `group_sizes` field on
  `ToneAudibilityResult` tells single tones from FG entries and the decisive
  audibility now follows Step 4 as printed.
- DIN 45681:2005-03 Anhang I oracle: the Tabelle I.9 wind-energy-plant
  spectrum reproduces the decisive Tabelle I.10 row end to end (LS 41,71 /
  LT 68,10 / dL 12,52 / u 3,18 dB), Tabelle I.11 rows j = 45/48 pin the
  Formulae (12)-(14) chain, the printed 5 FG row pins the two-tone
  combination decision, and Tabelle A.1 pins Formula (2) at 24 printed
  bandwidths.
- `verify_weighting_class`: a dense IEC 61672-1 5.5.7 sweep between the
  nominal frequencies (analytic Annex E design goal, larger of the adjacent
  limits) so a resonance or notch between nominals can no longer pass, and a
  `range_limited` flag when Table 3 rows with finite lower limits fall
  beyond Nyquist.
- `Barrier(line_of_sight_clear=True)`: the ISO 9613-2 negative-z sign
  convention when the sight line passes above the top edge; Eq. (14) is
  evaluated with Kmet = 1 and Dz decays continuously from 10 lg 3 at grazing
  to 0, never granting screening credit below the sight line.
- `wind_turbine_tonality`: the IEC 61400-11 9.5.2 possible-tone screening
  and a `has_identified_tone` flag (spectra without an identified tone must
  be excluded from the 9.5.1 bin averaging); `slant_distance` gains the
  vertical-axis Formula 2 (`rotor_axis="vertical"`, R0 = H + D).
- `uncertainty_from_repeated_measurements`: the primary ISO 1996-2
  Formulae (17)+(19) energy-domain route as `standard_uncertainty`, with the
  Note 2 substitute kept as `approximate_uncertainty` and a spread warning.
- `ResidualCorrectionResult.reportable_upper_bound`: the uncorrected
  measured level, the value 10.4 permits reporting when the margin is 3 dB
  or less; `ImpulseProminenceResult.qualifies`: the NT ACOU 112 clause 4.5
  onset-rate qualification mask.
- Published-oracle promotions: GUM Annex H.1 end to end through
  `combine_uncertainty` (uc = 31,71 nm, U99 = 92,1 nm), GUM Annex H.2 as the
  correlated Equation (16) oracle (uc(R/X/Z) = 0,071/0,295/0,236 ohm),
  GUM-S1 Tables 2 and 3 coverage intervals (+/-3,92 Gaussian, +/-3,88
  rectangular with a seeded Monte Carlo conformance entry), the full
  ISO 9613-2 Table 2 grid (6 conditions x 8 octave bands at exact midbands)
  and the IEC 61260-1 Table F.1 breakpoints with both E.3.4 rounding
  examples.
- New warning classes: `WindTurbineNoiseWarning`, `UncertaintyWarning` and
  `ImpulseProminenceWarning`.
- `itu_r_468_weighting`: the ITU-R BS.468-4 Table 1 weighting-network
  response (identical to the IEC 60268-1 Appendix A network that
  IEC 60268-3 14.12.11 requires), interpolated per the recommendation's own
  log-frequency rule; `weighted_thd` now defaults to it (`'468'`), keeps
  `'A'`/`'C'` as labelled options and documents the 31,5 Hz - 400 Hz
  fundamental validity range.
- AES17 measurement-bandwidth chain for `thd_plus_noise`, `sinad` and
  `harmonic_analysis`: both the residual and the total signal are measured
  through a 20 Hz high-pass plus the standard low-pass (clauses 5.2.5 /
  6.3.1) with a configurable `bandwidth` (default 20 kHz;
  `bandwidth=None` keeps the full-Nyquist measurement).
- `ModulationDistortionResult`: `modulation_distortion` now returns the
  IEC 60268-3 14.12.7 per-order values `d2`/`d3` together with the
  SMPTE-analyzer combined RMS as the explicitly labelled `smpte` field.
- Hearing and electroacoustics oracle expansion: the SII quiet condition at
  the official worksheet full precision plus a discriminating
  noise-plus-hearing-loss case and the independent R package Example C.2;
  the IEC 60268-16 Ed.5 C.3.2 STIPA direct-method staircase (m = 0 to 1
  through the full audio path, tolerance 0,05); the clipped-sine THD
  Fourier constants; a full-signal DIM regression (1,536 MHz synthesis of
  the standard test signal through a weak polynomial nonlinearity,
  FIR-decimated to 192 kHz, checked against an exact-bin FFT oracle); the
  H1 input-noise bias SNR/(1+SNR); the printed ITU-R 468 response values
  with the AES17 CCIR-RMS cross-check; and the effective notch-Q
  validation on the applied zero-phase response.
- ISO 532-1 Annex B.4 level-ramp oracles (Test signals 6-9): the tone and
  pink-noise ramps are regenerated from parameters measured on the official
  electronic-attachment WAVs and pinned to the workbook Nmax/N5 with
  tolerances calibrated against those WAVs; the sub-1-sone phon conversion
  and the NX percentile are now confirmed line by line against the
  attachment's Annex A.4 reference program source.
- `docs/ERRATA.md` entry for IEC 60268-3:2013 clause 14.12.9.2 f): the
  printed DIM denominator ("U2") contradicts the 14.12.9.1 definition
  (the output amplitude at f_s), which the library follows.
- ISO/PAS 20065:2016 extended uncertainty of the audibility (Clauses 5.4/6):
  `audibility_uncertainty` propagates the uniform 3 dB narrow-band level
  uncertainty through the audibility chain to the extended uncertainty U
  (90 % bilateral coverage, k = 1,645) and `mean_audibility_uncertainty`
  combines the per-spectrum values through the Formula (20) mean;
  `analyze_spectrum` reports the per-tone U on its result. Verified against
  the printed Table E.2 U column (decisive tone to 0,006 dB), the 2 FG row
  and the Annex E Step 4 mean uncertainty (1,38 dB).
- ISO 532-1 stationary `time_skip` parameter (Annex B.1's TimeSkip: the
  stationary calculation starts from 0,2 s when validating against the
  official recordings, excluding leading silence and the filterbank
  transient from the mean square).
- Psychoacoustics oracle expansion: the shipped ISO 532-1 Annex B.4 Test
  signal 13 and a B.3 pink-noise bounds check; all 21 DIN 45692 Table A.2
  rows and all 20 Table A.3 broadband rows at the normative 5 % / 0,05 acum
  tolerance (plus a non-definitional Table A.2 conformance row at 2,5 kHz);
  the ISO 532-2 Annex B phon columns; the ISO 532-3 Annex C.3 multi-tone
  complexes, the C.1.2/C.1.3 sone columns and the Annex C.1 anchor pinned at
  32/44,1/48 kHz native rates; the ECMA-418-2 decision thresholds as
  constants-tests (audibility 0,01 sone_HMS, prominent tonality 0,4 tu_HMS,
  prominent roughness 0,2 asper); a loudness/tonality N'_tonal
  cross-consistency test on the shared Clause 6.2 intermediate; the
  fluctuation-strength carrier sweep (F&Z Fig. 10.5 trend) and the Osses
  Table 1 AM-broadband-noise row as a trend cross-check; and the full
  ISO/PAS 20065 Tables E.2/E.3/E.4 columns (LG, av, band limits, per-tone
  and mean uncertainties, all-spectra tone records).
- ECMA-418-1 TNR/PR degenerate-input warnings: peaks within one bin of the
  89,1 Hz / 11,2 kHz range edge (bin snapping can flip the prominence
  verdict) and critical bands at numeric-noise power (silence, DC) now warn;
  the `prominent` verdict is documented as the numeric criterion only (the
  clause 11.8/12.8 aural examination and clause 8/9 hearing-threshold screen
  are the caller's responsibility).
- `docs/ERRATA.md` entries for the review findings: the ECMA-418-1 clause
  4.1.2 "11 220 Hz" range misprint, the internally inconsistent
  ECMA-418-2 clause 5.1.5.2 last-block formula, the ISO/PAS 20065 clause
  5.3.4 edge-steepness print that contradicts the executable DIN 45681
  Annex J program, and the Osses 2016 Eq. (3) Bark-constant exponent typo.
- Underwater printed-source oracles promoted to tests and the conformance
  report: the Wong & Zhu (1995) ITS-90 check tables pin the UNESCO and
  Del Grosso sound-speed refits at 17 printed grid points each (agreement
  within the printed 0.001 m/s resolution), the Francois & Garrison (1982,
  Part II) Table IV pins the total seawater absorption at 21 printed points
  spanning 0.4 kHz-1 MHz (within half a unit of the last printed digit), and
  the Wales & Heitmeyer (2002) ensemble merchant-ship mean spectrum is pinned
  against the paper's printed closed form and asymptote statements
  (exponents -3.6/-1.76, 340 Hz breakpoint).
- `docs/ERRATA.md`: a versioned registry of the defects found in published
  standards and guidance documents during implementation (misprints, worked
  examples contradicting their own normative text, ambiguous wording), each
  with the evidence, the library's disposition and a report status.
- ISO 7626-2:2015 measurement-side acceptance criteria:
  `rigid_mass_calibration_check` implements the 7.5.2 operational calibration
  on a rigid block of known mass (|A| = 1/m or |Y| = 1/(2 pi f m) within
  +/-5 %, per-band pass flags in a `RigidMassCalibrationResult`) and
  `random_error_percent` the Annex A normalized random error
  eps = sqrt((1-gamma^2)/(2 n gamma^2)) with the 8.1.3 < 5 % averaging
  criterion; measured-FRF processing per 8.1.3 (H1) and coherence checks are
  documented through the existing `transfer_function`/`coherence` estimators.
- ISO 10846-1:2008 Equation (6): `blocking_force_ratio` quantifies the
  blocking-force approximation F2/F2,b = 1/(1 + k2,2/kt) (within 10 % for
  |k2,2| < 0,1 |kt|, Eq. (7)).
- Vibration oracles promoted to tests and the conformance report: the nine
  printed ISO 8041-1:2017 Annex B design-goal tables (318 bands) with a
  Table 5 tolerance-envelope check and the Wb/Wc/Wd/We/Wf/Wj design-goal
  points, the ISO 2631-5:2018 Annex C NOTE 5 female worked example
  (Sd = 1,40 MPa, R = 0,97) and the Annex D Table D.1 digital-filter
  cross-check of Formula 1, the ISO 7626-2 rigid-mass calibration values and
  Annex A random-error example, the omega = 1000 rad/s rigid-mass decade
  identity, the ISO 10846-3 validity anchors (|T| = 0,1 <->
  DeltaL1,2 = 20 dB, model bias 1,1 within 1 dB / 12 %), the ISO 10846-1
  Eq. (6) force ratio 1/1,1 and the 7.6 linearity criterion (10 dB input
  step within 1,5 dB).
- ISO 717 enlarged frequency ranges: `weighted_rating_extended` computes the
  Annex B spectrum adaptation terms (C50-3150, C50-5000, C100-5000 and the
  Ctr counterparts, Table B.1 spectra) and `weighted_impact_rating_extended`
  the CI,50-2500 term of ISO 717-2:2020 A.2.1; both offer the 0,1 dB
  reference-curve shift and one-decimal reductions for uncertainty statements
  (ISO 12999-1:2020 Annex B), reproducing the printed Rw = 57,4 dB example
  and the A.2.2 constants Ln,r,0,w = 77,6 dB / CI,r,0 = -10,3 dB.
- ISO 16251-1 statement of results: the floor-covering improvement now rates
  any spectrum containing the 16 bands 100-3150 Hz (the clause 6.3 18-band
  range included) and exposes the spectrum adaptation term CI,delta
  (ISO 717-2:2020 Formula (A.4)) as `ci_delta` /
  `impact_improvement_adaptation_term`.
- EN 15657:2018 source-quantity chain: `equivalent_blocked_force_level`
  (Formula 15), `characteristic_reception_plate_power` (Formula 17,
  Y_R,inf,low = 5e-6 m/(N s)), `equivalent_free_velocity_level` (Formula 18)
  and `source_mobility_from_levels` (Formula 19), plus the EN 12354-5 Annex I
  mobility correction `installed_power_from_reception_plate`; the raw
  Formula (14) level is re-documented as the plate-injected power.
- ISO 9611:1996 `mean_free_velocity_level` (equation (9) energy mean over
  contact points, v0 = 5e-8 m/s) with a conformance check.
- EN 12354-1 Annex E junction families E.7 (lightweight double leaf with
  homogeneous elements), E.8 (coupled double-leaf walls) and E.9 (corner and
  thickness change), and the E.5 K24 double-leaf branch (clamp read as
  -4 dB <= K24 <= 0 dB; the 2000 print's "0 <= K24 <= -4 dB" is a misprint).
- EN 12354-1 Formula (5b) `standardized_level_difference` (DnT,w from R'w,
  exact 0,32 V/Ss form) closing both Annex H.3 examples to 54 dB.
- EN 12354-3 Annex C facade-shape term lookup
  `facade_shape_level_difference` (Figure C.2, all nine shapes, alpha_w
  interpolation).
- ISO 10848-4 Clause 9 modal-overlap bracketing: `vibration_reduction_index`
  accepts the per-band modal overlap factor, flags M < 0,25 bands as
  `bracketed` and excludes them from the single-number Kij.
- ISO 15186-1 Clause 6.4.6 negative-direction subareas: `combine_subareas`
  accepts signed subarea areas (minus sign for reverse energy flow) with
  Sm = sum(|Smi|), raising when the signed energy sum is not positive.
- Oracles promoted to tests and the conformance report: ISO 717-1:2020
  Annex C Table C.2 (enlarged 50-5000 Hz range), ISO 717-2 Annex C Table C.1
  covered floor (64, -3, 30,0 dB) and Table C.2 improvement (15 dB,
  CI,delta = -9 dB), ISO 12999-1:2020 Annex B single numbers and
  uncorrelated/correlated uncertainties, all 12 printed EN 12354-1 Annex H.3
  path values with the DnT,w closures, the remaining EN 12354-4 Table G.9
  reception cells, ISO 10140-5 Tables B.1/C.1 reference elements and floors
  end-to-end, the printed ISO 15186-1 Table B.1 Kc rows, and the EN 12354-5
  Annex I whirlpool (Table I.6a) and flushing cistern (Tables I.8/I.9)
  worked examples replacing the former formula-restatement checks.
- Underwater validation: independent image-source absolute TL anchors for the
  normal-mode and parabolic-equation solvers, the published UNESCO EOS-80
  canonical sound-speed check value (Fofonoff & Millard 1983), six additional
  JOMOPANS File S1 oracle rows, the Ainslie-McColm Table I reference oceans
  against Francois-Garrison, Wenz-chart graphical anchors for the wind noise,
  and the RANDI 3.1 report's representative source levels (Table 2) for the
  ship-spectrum model; two new conformance checks (198 total).
- ECAC Doc 32 rotorcraft: `reference_distance` parameter on
  `spherical_spreading_adjustment` and `atmospheric_adjustment` for hemispheres
  recorded at a non-standard polar distance, and an end-to-end propagation-chain
  oracle against the NORAH2 prototype single-event histories (0.1 dB(A) over
  hard ground) plus off-node bilinear spot checks on the reference hemispheres
  of all eleven rotorcraft types.
- ECAC Doc 29 airport noise: landing-rollout modelling (`landing_roll` mask;
  reduced noise fraction Eq. 4-21b, nearest-end geometry, no directivity term)
  and per-segment bank angle (`bank`, §4.5.2 sign convention). ICAO Annex 16
  EPNL: the bandsharing adjustment ΔB (App. 2 §4.4.2/4.4.3), exposed as
  `EPNLResult.bandsharing_adjustment`, and a `start_band` parameter on
  `tone_correction` for the helicopter 50 Hz procedure.
- STIPA certified-bench verification: the IEC 60268-16 rev 5 verification
  test-bench signals from stipa.info (Embedded Acoustics BV) run as a local
  end-to-end oracle over `stipa` / `sti_from_impulse_response` (49 WAVs
  across Annexes C.3.2 modulation-depth staircase, C.3.3 exponential decays,
  C.4.2 filter slope, A.2.2 weighting factors and A.3.1.2 phase distortion;
  the suite skips cleanly when the local data is absent), plus seven synthetic
  conformance checks that re-derive the same constructions in CI (one of them
  replacing the previous C.3.2 m = 0,5 check, so the total grows by six): the
  C.3.2 staircase at m = 0,2/0,5/0,8 (±0,01 STI), the C.3.3 RT60 = 1 s decay
  against the closed-form Schroeder MTF (±0,005), the C.4.2 slope criterion
  (m ≥ 0,5 under a +41 dB unmodulated adjacent-octave tone) and the
  A.2.2/A.3.1.2 audio-path checks (257 checks total).
- `fluctuation_strength_ecma`: the normative psychoacoustic fluctuation
  strength of ECMA-418-2:2025 Clause 9 (Sottek Hearing Model, vacil_HMS),
  completing the standard's metric set next to `loudness_ecma`,
  `tonality_ecma` and `roughness_ecma`. Implements the High-resolution
  Spectral Analysis of the critical-band envelopes (least-squares
  window-kernel line-pair fits, Formulae 121-142), the envelope-dependent
  analysis windows with quieter-period detection (Clause 9.1.3), the
  band-pass modulation-rate weighting, damped-Newton rate fine tuning and
  harmonic-complex analysis (Clauses 9.1.5-9.1.9) and the HSA-based loudness
  scaling (Clause 9.1.10), reusing the shared Clause 5 auditory front-end.
  The frozen `EcmaFluctuationStrength` result exposes `.plot()` (F(l50)
  trace plus specific-fluctuation-strength heatmap). Reproduces the Clause 9
  calibration signal (1 kHz, 100 % AM at 4 Hz, overall 60 dB SPL) to
  0.9958 vacil_HMS converged with the tabulated `c_F` (no reverse fitting), pinned in CI
  together with closed-form HSA recovery anchors and the standard's
  qualitative band-pass behaviours; `docs/ERRATA.md` records four confirmed
  Clause 9 print defects (the Formula (127) kernel phase, the Formula (144)
  bin offset, the unit-less Newton constants of Clause 9.1.7 and a broken
  cross-reference).
- `SoundAbsorptionMeasurement` and `measure_sound_absorption`: a public
  reverberation-room sound absorption measurement result type (BS EN
  ISO 354:2003). It carries the one-third-octave reverberation times of the
  empty room and of the room with the specimen, the room volume, the specimen
  area and the climate, and derives the equivalent sound absorption areas `A1`
  (Eq. (5)) and `A2` (Eq. (7)) and the sound absorption coefficient `alpha_s`
  (Eq. (8)/(9)) by reusing the existing `absorption_area`/`absorption_coefficient`
  functions; `alpha_s` may exceed 1,0 (Clause 3.7 NOTE 2) and is never clamped.
  The result exposes `.plot()` (`alpha_s` versus one-third-octave frequency) and
  `.report()`, which renders a one-page accredited reverberation-room test-report
  PDF (metadata header, the `alpha_s` table beside the curve, `verbose=True`
  adding the `T1`/`T2` and `A1`/`A2` detail columns). ISO 354 is a
  characterisation, so the fiche has no single-number rating and no pass/fail
  verdict; the weighted `alpha_w` remains the separate ISO 11654 rating.
- `RoomAcousticsResult.report()`: a one-page PDF room acoustic parameters
  measurement fiche (ISO 3382-1:2009 performance spaces, ISO 3382-2:2008
  ordinary rooms, both by the integrated impulse-response method). It renders
  the standard-basis line, an optional metadata header, the full-width per-band
  parameter table (T20, T30, EDT, C50, C80, D50 and Ts, one row per octave or
  one-third-octave band) above the result's own per-band decay-time plot, and
  the boxed mid-frequency reverberation time T_mid (the mean of the 500 Hz and
  1000 Hz octave T30). ISO 3382-1/-2 are characterisation standards with no
  intrinsic pass/fail, so the verdict row appears only when a target T_mid is
  supplied through `ReportMetadata.requirement` (read as the maximum acceptable
  T_mid). Uses the same `ReportMetadata` container and reportlab engine as the
  ISO 717 / ISO 11654 fiches, in English or Spanish (`language="es"`). The
  committed example fiche renders an auditorium octave-band measurement whose
  synthetic single-slope decay fixes the reverberation-time columns at their
  closed-form values (T20 = T30 = EDT = T per band, since a pure exponential
  energy decay gives the straight Schroeder line L(t) = -60 t / T of
  ISO 3382-1:2009, 5.3.3).
- `ReportMetadata`: three room-acoustics fields, `room_volume` (the volume of
  the single room under test, in m^3; ISO 3382-2:2008 Clause 9), and the
  `source_positions` / `receiver_positions` counts (ISO 3382-1:2009 Table 1 and
  ISO 3382-2:2008 Clause 8), populating the room fiche header. `room_volume` is
  validated as a finite positive number and the position counts as positive
  integers, matching the existing field-validation style.

### Changed
- Raised the `scipy` floor in `pyproject.toml` to `scipy>=1.18.0`, the minimum
  supported scipy version, matching the floor `requirements.txt` already
  carried. The
  `numpy` floor stays at `>=2.4.4` because the optional `perf` extra pulls
  numba, which still requires NumPy 2.4 or older; the pure-Python matrix and the
  figure stack already run on the latest NumPy through their own pins.
- Spanish acoustics terminology in the figure generators now matches the
  official UNE-EN wording used by the `.plot()` string tables: "reducción
  sonora" becomes "reducción acústica" (sound reduction index R, UNE-EN
  ISO 717-1), "reducción vibracional" becomes "reducción de vibraciones"
  (vibration reduction index Kij, UNE-EN ISO 10848), and "potencia sonora"
  becomes "potencia acústica" (sound power level LW, UNE-EN ISO 3740 series).
  The affected Spanish figures and the Spanish guide prose describing them
  were regenerated and corrected to match.
- Plot readability: continuous logarithmic frequency axes now label the octave
  band centres present in the data range (16 Hz, 31.5 Hz, ..., 16 kHz shown as
  `1k`, `2k`, ...) with unlabelled one-third-octave minor ticks, replacing the
  `10^2` / `10^3` power-of-ten ticks that read poorly in acoustics. A shared
  `format_frequency_axis` helper drives the change across every `.plot()`
  renderer and the documentation figures; time, distance, harmonic-order,
  Fresnel-number, flow-resistivity, modulation-frequency and normalized-
  frequency axes are unaffected.
- Docs prose: swept the remaining em-dashes out of the editorial text across
  the GitHub guides, the EN and ES site guides, theory chapters, landings and
  frontmatter descriptions, rewriting each sentence with standard punctuation
  while preserving em-dashes inside official standard titles, citations and
  table placeholders.
- Docs site build and assets: a postbuild step recompresses the raster images
  the site serves (the social card drops from 663 KiB to 337 KiB, sources
  untouched), prerendered pages render four at a time, the pa11y audit covers
  the six migrated guide URLs, and the programme-loudness page titles were
  shortened to satisfy the html-validate long-title gate.
- The multiple-shock whole-body vibration module (ISO 2631-5:2018) now
  documents its axis scope: the spinal-response model is vertical-axis only by
  design (clause 4a neglects the horizontal contributions to spinal
  compression), and horizontal whole-body exposure should be assessed with the
  ISO 2631-1 weighted r.m.s. and VDV metrics already in the vibration domain.
  Docstrings and the guide (EN + ES) gain the clarification; no behaviour
  change.
- Dependency refresh across the toolchains: the development tools move to
  ruff >=0.15.21, mypy >=2.3.0 and types-setuptools >=83.0.0.20260716; the
  docs site moves to Astro 7.0.9 and html-validate 11.5.6; the docs deploy
  workflow moves to actions/setup-node v7. The pinned figure-rendering stack
  (`requirements-figures.txt`) was already at the current releases, so the
  committed figures are unchanged (verified with a full regeneration), and
  the runtime floors (numpy/scipy, optional matplotlib/numba) stay put since
  no newer APIs are required.
- The raster documentation figures (the seven `_PNG_FIGURES`: spectrogram,
  excitation signals, Schroeder decay, calibration stability, impulse
  response, numerical propagation and airport contour, across the EN/ES x
  light/dark variants) now render at 300 DPI instead of 150, doubling their
  pixel dimensions so they stay crisp on high-density displays and when
  zoomed. The docs embeds size them by percentage width, so no layout change
  was needed. Each PNG is also losslessly recompressed at save time with a
  deterministic `oxipng` pass (via the pinned `pyoxipng==9.1.1`), which
  shrinks the files ~25-30% without changing a single pixel; because the
  optimization is a pure function of the input, `make graphs` stays
  byte-reproducible and `scripts/check_figures.py` still matches a fresh
  regeneration.
- The documentation animations now render at 300 DPI (2400x1350, from
  800x450) for crisp playback on high-density displays, keeping the same
  8x4.5 figure so no layout re-tuning is needed. The VP9 WebM encode gains
  screen-content tuning and row multithreading (`-tune-content screen
  -row-mt 1 -deadline good -cpu-used 4`), which roughly halves the encode
  time at the same file size; the GitHub GIF fallback stays at 640 px. All
  16 clips (four language x theme variants each) now render on a spawned
  process pool, one grouped task per clip so each FDTD field is simulated
  once and reused across its variants; `make animations` and the `--jobs`
  flag drive it, while `--anim NAME` keeps the single-clip re-render
  sequential. The site `<video>` embeds and posters follow the new intrinsic
  size. A handful of on-canvas readability fixes ride along: Spanish decimal
  commas in the FDTD time readouts, repositioned time and caption labels so
  they clear tick labels and legends, a legible dark pill behind the ducting
  channel-axis label, a mathtext `L_W` subscript in the two-rooms readout,
  and the onset magnifier kept fully inside its panel.
- The four Tier-1 documentation animations are redesigned as mechanism
  infographics instead of line-plot reveals: `anim_time_weighting` shows the
  tone burst driving the IEC 61672-1 RC detector (square-law rectifier,
  capacitor charging/draining, F/S/I meter needles), `anim_onset_detection`
  scans L_AF with a magnifier and lights the NT ACOU 112 OR/LD/P/KI decision
  chain, `anim_instantaneous_intensity` animates a two-microphone p-p probe
  with p/u phasors and a flipping intensity arrow (active vs reactive), and
  `anim_schroeder` fills the tail energy of the squared impulse response
  while the decay curve and T20/T30 fits emerge on a companion axis. A
  shared scaffold (schematic axes, mic symbols, meter gauges, pipeline
  boxes, updatable arrows) backs all clips; filenames and the WebM/GIF
  variant pipeline are unchanged. Every animation embed now loads deferred
  with its space pre-reserved: `_save_animation` exports a poster still per
  WebM variant (`anim_<name>[_es][_dark]_poster.jpg`, a frame inside the
  closing hold; JPEG so the posters stay outside the SVG/PNG `make graphs` /
  `check_figures.py` pipeline, refreshable via `make posters` /
  `--posters`), the site `<video>` embeds use `preload="none"` plus the
  poster and explicit `width`/`height` (no `autoplay`), and the GitHub-docs
  GIF embeds carry `loading="lazy"` with their intrinsic size, so no clip
  fetches eagerly and none shifts the layout while loading. Future clips
  inherit the convention automatically.
- `scripts/generate_graphs.py` renders the documentation figures on a
  process pool: each (figure, language, theme) combination is an independent
  task (spawned workers, language/theme applied per task), except the five
  psychoacoustic figures whose `lru_cache`-memoised ECMA-418-2 / ISO 532
  analyses render their four variants grouped in one worker so the cache
  reuse of the sequential run is preserved. Output is byte-identical to the
  sequential run (all 624 committed assets hash-equal on the same machine);
  the full four-variant regeneration drops from 196 s to 53 s on a 12-core
  dev box. New CLI flags: `--jobs N` (default: cores minus two, capped at 8;
  `--jobs 1` keeps the old in-process sequential path) and `--figure NAME`
  (repeatable single-figure filter); `--animations` / `--all` are unchanged
  and the clips still render sequentially.
- ECMA-418-2 chain: the per-lag Python loop of the unbiased ACF
  normalization (Formulae 27-29) is now column-vectorised, the Clause 6.2.3
  neighbour-band averaging accumulates without the stacked copy, the ACF
  normalization reuses the block-RMS energy array, and the roughness
  Clause 7.1.7 pchip
  interpolation runs all 53 bands in one call. Outputs are bit-identical
  (guarded by bitwise equivalence tests against retained reference loops and
  the golden baseline); on the 0.5 s bench signal `loudness_ecma` drops from
  2.78 s to 2.00 s, `tonality_ecma` from 2.74 s to 2.01 s and
  `roughness_ecma` from 0.24 s to 0.23 s. The remaining runtime is the
  standard-mandated 16384-point DFTs, which no bit-preserving reformulation
  (rfft, one-sided magnitudes, batched or alternative FFT backends) can
  reduce.
- ECAC Doc 29 `noise_contour` now evaluates the grid with one vectorised pass
  per flight-path segment instead of a per-point Python loop; numerically
  identical (guarded by the golden baseline and a scalar-equivalence test)
  and ~45x faster on small grids, several hundred times on production-size
  grids (30 000 points in ~0.2 s).
- The test suite now runs in parallel: `make test`, `make coverage` and the CI
  test job invoke `pytest -n auto` (pytest-xdist, added to the dev
  requirements) so the 3241 tests fan out across every CPU core. Each worker
  pins its numerical thread pools to a single thread
  (`OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` and the MKL/OpenBLAS/NumExpr/Accelerate equivalents) so
  the per-core workers do not oversubscribe the machine with nested BLAS
  pools. On a 12-core host the full suite drops from 508 s to 138 s wall-clock
  (about 3.7x); pytest-cov combines the per-worker coverage so the Codecov
  upload is unchanged (identical 96% line coverage, same 13914 statements).
  Two supporting test changes: the Annex C.1 Moore-Glasberg time-varying
  loudness checks share one memoised result per distinct tone (the phon and
  sone suites analysed the same signals independently), and the ECMA-418-2
  roughness peak/depth checks reuse the module calibration result instead of
  recomputing it - no oracle, tolerance or covered line changes. The pink-noise
  flatness test no longer writes a throwaway debug PNG to a fixed path (it
  raced under parallel workers and left an untracked file); its numerical
  assertion is untouched.

### Fixed
- `shaped_sweep_signal()` no longer returns a NaN or infinite crest factor
  when a very small `seconds` next to a dominant `start_delay` rounds the two
  edges of the constant-envelope window onto the same sample and leaves an
  empty core slice: it now falls back to the whole retained sweep in that
  degenerate case.
- The shaped-sweep spectrum plot no longer crashes when the Welch grid,
  resolved independently of the synthesis grid, leaves no bin inside a narrow
  `(f1, f2)` band on a short signal: the Welch magnitude now falls back to its
  overall positive-frequency maximum as the normalization reference so the plot
  still renders.
- The `regularized_inverse_filter()` result documents `max_gain_db` as the
  achieved peak-normalized out-of-band gain the code actually returns (the
  computation is unchanged and stays conformance-pinned), and its `plot()`
  return type is narrowed to a single `Axes`.
- The documentation figures now render every text run in the viewer's native
  sans-serif font: I normalise all `font-family` declarations in the generated
  SVGs to the generic `sans-serif`, so viewers without DejaVu Sans no longer
  fall back to a serif for the mathtext labels while the surrounding prose
  stays sans. Text remains selectable.
- The EBU R 128 programme-loudness fiche no longer passes the verdict on the
  obsolete blanket ±0.5 LU tolerance (the June 2014 V3 rule, superseded in
  the August 2020 V4 revision and absent from R 128-2023).
  `ProgramLoudnessResult.report()` now selects the tolerance explicitly via a
  `tolerance` keyword: the default `"qc"` applies the ±0.2 LU
  measurement-error allowance of R 128 item i) (loudness workflows such as
  Quality Control) and `"live"` applies the ±1.0 LU tolerance of item h),
  permitted only where the Target Level is not achievable practically; the
  fiche prints the applied rule and its R 128 item. A non-live programme at
  −23.5 LUFS, previously rendered PASS, now correctly fails the default rule.
- Fiche verdicts are now evaluated on the value rounded exactly as displayed,
  so the printed numbers can no longer contradict the pass/fail at a
  tolerance boundary: the programme-loudness delta is compared at the 0.1 LU
  display precision of EBU Tech 3341, the EPNL is determined once to one
  decimal place (as Annex 16 states it) before the level, margin and status
  are derived, and the ISO 532-1 loudness verdict compares the one-decimal
  displayed value. Tiny negative values no longer print as "-0.0".
- `effective_perceived_noise_level()` gains a `procedure` keyword
  (`"aeroplane"` default, `"helicopter"`) that plumbs the tone-correction
  start band of ICAO Annex 16 Vol I App. 2, 4.3.1 Step 1 through the public
  EPNL chain: helicopters and tilt-rotors start the slope analysis at the
  50 Hz band, so rotor tones in the 50-80 Hz bands are no longer silently
  outside the analysis when the spectrum is processed with the default
  aeroplane procedure.
- The ISO 717 fiche now declares the band set actually rated (an octave-band
  rating was captioned "One-third-octave", contradicting the clause 4.4
  statement requirement) and can name the reported single-number quantity via
  a `symbol` keyword on `report()` (e.g. `"DnT,w"`, `"L'nT,w"`), so a field
  measurement is no longer mislabelled with the laboratory `Rw` / `Ln,w`
  descriptor; spectrum-adaptation terms print a sign only when negative,
  matching the standard's own examples.
- The ISO 532-1 fiche now reports the items clause 7 makes mandatory: the
  method used (stationary, clause 5, or time-varying, clause 6), the sound
  field (`ZwickerLoudness` gains a `field` attribute set by the
  constructors), the loudness-versus-time function N(t) for time-varying
  sounds and the "maximum loudness Nmax" labelling of the reported maximum.
- `verify_filter_class()` / `filter_class_compliance()` now report when the
  verification is range-limited: the stop-band mask beyond each band's
  processing Nyquist cannot be exercised at the decimated rate (the
  `range_limited` flag and per-band `checked_to_omega` record it), and the
  IEC 61260-1 fiche qualifies its COMPLIES statement accordingly instead of
  asserting unqualified full-mask conformance. The fiche also labels bands
  with the nominal mid-band frequencies both editions identify filters by
  (125 Hz, not the exact 125.89.. Hz), cites the 1995 edition's own
  relative-attenuation definition instead of a 2014-only formula number, and
  rejects a `required_class` that does not exist in the verified edition
  (class 0 against a 2014 result previously rendered a meaningless FAIL).
- Spanish fiches (`language="es"`) now localise the embedded chart too: the
  fiche language is forwarded to the result's own `plot()`, so axis labels
  and legends render in Spanish instead of English.
- Fiche header grids reprint client-supplied metadata verbatim instead of
  display-rounding it (an area of 1.23 m² was printed as "1.2"), and the
  ISO 11654 fiche writes the shape indicator in the clause 5.3 style
  (`0.60(M)`, no space) with the 5.3 NOTE recommendation printed when an
  indicator applies.
- `LoudspeakerCharacteristics.minimum_impedance` now evaluates the lowest
  impedance modulus over the rated frequency range when
  `rated_frequency_range` is supplied, as IEC 60268-5 clause 16.1 requires
  ("the lowest value of the modulus of the impedance in the rated frequency
  range shall be not less than 80 % of the rated impedance"), falling back to
  the computed effective frequency range only when no rated range is stated.
  The property previously always scanned the effective range, which clause
  19.1 NOTE 2 warns may differ from the rated range (particularly for woofers
  and tweeters), so an impedance dip below 80 % of the rated impedance inside
  the rated range but outside the effective range went undetected.
- `vibration.wave_vibration_reduction_index` now implements Hopkins (2007)
  Eq. 5.116 exactly: `Kij = 10 lg(1/tau_ij) + 5 lg(fc_j/f_ref)` with the
  reference frequency `f_ref = 1000 Hz`, instead of the previous
  `5 lg(fc_j/fc_i)` correction term. The old form broke the required symmetry
  of the junction descriptor (`Kij = Kji`, guaranteed by the Eq. 5.7
  reciprocity of the angular-average transmission coefficients): an L-junction
  of 100 mm and 215 mm concrete plates returned 6.81 dB in one direction and
  8.09 dB in the other where the correct symmetric value is 2.97 dB. The
  function signature changed accordingly (it now takes the receiving plate's
  `critical_frequency_receiver` instead of the optional source/receiver pair),
  `junction_transmission` computes both plates' thin-plate critical frequencies
  (`fc = sqrt(12) c0^2 / (2 pi h cL)`, `c0 = 343 m/s`) and stores them on
  `JunctionTransmissionResult.critical_frequency1`/`critical_frequency2`, and
  `corner_reduction_index` uses the receiving plate's value.
- The ISO 4871 declared single-number values
  (`OperatingModeDeclaration.declared_sound_power_level` and
  `.declared_emission_pressure_level`) now round the sum `L + K` once to the
  nearest decibel, as clause 3.15 defines (`L_d = L + K`, the sum of the
  unrounded quantities rounded to the nearest decibel), instead of adding the
  separately rounded `L` and `K` of the dual-number form (clause 3.16). The
  previous behaviour could understate the declared value by 1 dB (for example
  `L_WA = 91.4`, `K_WA = 2.4` gave 93 dB instead of 94 dB) and thereby flip
  the clause 6.2 verification verdict at the boundary.
- `aircraft.load_anp_database` no longer interleaves distinct fixed-point
  profiles: the parser now keys each trajectory on the full ANP identity
  (aircraft, operation, profile identifier, stage length) instead of dropping
  `Profile_ID`, so aircraft shipping several profiles for the same operation
  and stage length (e.g. `CNA206`/`CNA20T` departures with `DEFAULT` and
  `3000LB` weight variants) load each profile whole instead of a physically
  impossible 18-point merge. `AnpDatabase.profile` and `AnpAircraft.profile`
  gained an optional `profile_id=` keyword; without it the `DEFAULT` profile is
  selected when present, a single available profile is used, and an ambiguous
  request raises listing the identifiers. Duplicate or non-consecutive point
  numbers within a profile now raise instead of silently corrupting the path.
- `aircraft.event_level` and `aircraft.noise_contour` apply the ECAC Doc 29
  Vol 2 §4.5.2 bank-angle sign to the correct observer side: the depression
  angle is now `φ = β + ε` for observers to starboard (right of the flight
  direction) and `φ = β − ε` for observers to port. The sign was inverted, so
  the lateral-directivity (engine-installation) correction of every banked
  segment was mirrored between the inside and outside of a turn.
- `noise_control.silencers.transmission_loss` had the four-pole prefactor
  inverted (`Z1/Zn` instead of `Zn/Z1`), overstating the transmission loss by
  `20 lg(S_out/S_in)` whenever the inlet and outlet port areas differed: a
  zero-length element between 0.01 and 0.02 m2 (a sudden expansion, classic
  `TL = 10 lg[(1+m)^2/(4m)] = 0.512 dB`) came out as 6.532 dB, and the TL of
  an unequal-port chamber was not reciprocal (11.34 vs -0.70 dB, a negative
  loss for a passive element). The formula now follows Munjal, *Acoustics of
  Ducts and Mufflers* 2e, Eq. (3.27), reproduces the sudden-expansion limit
  exactly in both directions and is reciprocal; regression tests pin both.
  The four shipped silencer builders call it with equal port areas, so their
  results are unchanged. Bies 5e Eq. (8.141) as printed also fails the
  sudden-expansion limit (1.938 dB) and is now registered in
  `docs/ERRATA.md`.
- `environmental.ground_effect`, `environmental.spherical_reflection_coefficient`,
  the ground-reflected paths of `environmental.barrier_insertion_loss` and the
  ground condition of `environmental.atmospheric_parabolic_equation` now
  conjugate the impedance obtained from the porous models of
  `phonometry.materials` (the `flow_resistivity=` path and any
  `PorousMediumResult`). The materials domain works in the `e^{+jωt}` time
  convention (`Im(Z) < 0` for a passive medium) while the Salomons formulas
  behind these functions require `e^{-iωt}` (`Im(Z) > 0`); the impedance used
  to cross that boundary unconjugated, so the phase of the spherical-wave
  reflection coefficient `Q` was wrong and the soft-ground interference dip
  almost vanished (Salomons Fig. D.3 geometry, grassland
  `σ = 200 kPa·s/m²`, `hs = hr = 2 m`, `r = 100 m`: the library gave a
  `-0.55 dB` minimum where the correct dip is `-12.7 dB` near `395 Hz`, now
  pinned by test and conformance oracle). User-supplied `impedance=` values are
  now documented as `e^{-iωt}` with `Im(Z) > 0` for a passive ground (the
  docstrings previously asserted the opposite sign), matching the convention of
  `aircraft.rotorcraft_noise.ground_effect_adjustment`.
- `environmental.atmospheric_parabolic_equation` adds the surface-wave term of
  the GFPE range step (the residue of the ground-reflection pole at
  `kz = -k0/Z`, third term of Salomons Eq. (H.49)), which is active for a
  passive finite-impedance ground; without it the homogeneous-atmosphere field
  drifted by up to about 1 dB from the Weyl-Van der Pol oracle once the
  impedance convention was corrected.
- `building.critical_frequency` (flanking, ISO 12354-1:2017 Formula (20)) dropped
  a spurious factor of pi that made the thin-plate critical frequency about 3.14
  times too low (for example roughly 670 Hz instead of about 2100 Hz for 6 mm
  glass). The value now matches the closed-form plate coincidence frequency
  `coincidence_frequency` to within the rounding of the 1.8 constant.
- Reverberation-time prediction no longer rejects absorption coefficients
  at or above 1 for every model with a blanket `[0, 1)` validator; each
  model now enforces its own mathematical domain. Sabine accepts measured
  ISO 354 coefficients at or above 1 (its linear absorption area stays
  finite), including the exact 1.0 of the ISO 11654 practical-coefficient
  cap, up to a unit-error guard at 2 that catches percentages passed
  where fractions are expected. Eyring accepts individual coefficients at
  or above 1 as long as the mean absorption entering `ln(1 - mean)` stays
  below 1, and Millington-Sette keeps the strict per-surface requirement
  (every coefficient below 1) that its per-surface logarithm demands;
  Fitzroy and Arau-Puchades keep requiring each wall-pair mean below 1,
  since their inputs enter the axial logarithm directly. NaN inputs, which
  the old range comparisons silently let through both as coefficients and
  as `air_attenuation`, are now rejected with explicit finiteness checks.
- Documentation site rendering on phones: wide parameter tables (4+
  columns with a long-text notes column) no longer crush every column to a
  few characters per line with enormously tall cells; on narrow screens
  their cells keep a readable minimum width (16rem for the trailing notes
  column) and the table scrolls horizontally inside Starlight's scroll
  container instead (new `site/src/styles/theme-tables.css`, desktop
  rendering unchanged); these wide tables also get `tabindex="0"` and a
  visible focus outline so the scroll container stays keyboard-reachable
  on Safari/WebKit, which unlike Chrome and Firefox does not focus
  scrollable regions by default. Figure widths on phones now cover the whole
  authored tier inventory with a generic selector: every
  `<img style="width:NN%">` and video spans the full reading column on
  screens up to 50rem, where tiers such as 60/70/72/75/78/82/86/90/94/96%
  previously kept wasted side margins and left axis labels illegible.
- G-weighting (ISO 7196) digital design is now sample-rate aware: at the low
  sample rates common for infrasound recordings, 315 Hz approaches Nyquist
  and the un-prewarped bilinear design warped the upper response; the design
  now oversamples toward 48 kHz so the response at 315 Hz stays within a few
  hundredths of a dB of the 48 kHz design at any rate (at 48 kHz and above
  the design is unchanged).
- STI analysis filter bank is now zero-phase (forward-backward filtering):
  the single-pass bank failed two normative verification criteria of
  IEC 60268-16:2020 on the certified test bench - the C.4.2 filter-slope
  test (an unmodulated tone one octave below the observed band, 41 dB
  louder, leaked with only ~31 dB attenuation and dragged the measured m
  down to ~0,1 against the m ≥ 0,5 criterion) and the A.3.1.2
  phase-distortion limit (STI bias reached -0,020 at TI = 0,9 against the
  < 0,01 criterion). Zero-phase filtering removes the phase bias by
  construction and doubles the effective skirt attenuation to ~63 dB one
  octave out; all 49 certified bench signals now pass (worst slope-test
  m = 0,937, worst edge-carrier bias -0,0029). STI values on ordinary
  signals of the recommended >= 15 s duration shift by at most ~0,003
  (larger only below the minimum-duration warning threshold; the
  sti_vs_t60 figures are regenerated accordingly).
- `stipa` no longer raises when an octave band of the recording carries no
  energy: dead bands read m = 0 (TI = 0, the worst-case reading of a real
  meter) under an `STIWarning`, so component-level verification signals
  that deliberately occupy only some bands (IEC 60268-16 C.4.2) remain
  measurable.
- DIN 45681 / ISO PAS 20065 single-line tones: the tone level of a K = 1 run
  is the line level itself (Formula (7)); the Hanning bandwidth correction
  applies only to K > 1 sums (Formula (8)). The unconditional -1,76 dB
  understated every single-line audibility and could flip weak
  near-bin-centred tones to inaudible.
- `verify_weighting_class` and the conformance report's A/C branch evaluate
  the SOS at the exact base-10 frequencies behind the Table 3 nominal labels
  (Table 3 NOTE; IEC 61672-3 13.3), removing a pairing bias of up to
  0,27 dB; `verify_filter_class` evaluates the Table 1 breakpoints exactly
  with `sosfreqz` instead of interpolating off the grid (the 16-point floor
  now reproduces the dense-grid verdict).
- IEC 61400-11 tone classification anchors the 10 dB cut, the reported tone
  frequency and the Formula 34 criterion to the highest classified tone
  line (9.5.3/9.5.4), not the probed candidate; truncated critical bands
  warn and candidates below 20 Hz are rejected.
- ISO 1996-2 residual correction: with a margin of 3 dB or less no
  correction is allowed and the uncorrected level is the reportable upper
  bound (the previous wording inverted the bound);
  `gaussian_residual_level` rejects inverted percentile orderings.
- ISO 9613-2 `atmospheric_absorption` evaluates alpha at the exact base-10
  midbands (the Table 2 convention; ~1,3 % high at 8 kHz before); grazing
  barrier geometry (z = 0) now yields Dz = 10 lg 3 instead of 0.
- GUM `combine_uncertainty`: a correlated budget with finite input degrees
  of freedom carries undefined effective dof (the GUM defines no correlated
  Welch-Satterthwaite form; r = 0,999 with nu = 5 previously produced
  k95 ~ 2e151) and `expanded()` then requires an explicit coverage factor;
  the finite-difference step is the input uncertainty with a 64-ULP floor,
  preserving locality for large-magnitude inputs while a tiny uncertainty
  on a large value no longer underflows to uc = 0; `monte_carlo` rejects
  trials < 2.
- NT ACOU 112: level rises with onset rates at or below 10 dB/s no longer
  produce a KI adjustment (clauses 4.5/8).
- `sensitivity()` rejects non-finite reference samples (a NaN propagated
  silently to a NaN calibration factor); docstring thresholds aligned with
  IEC 60942:2017 Table 2 and the plain-bilinear weighting class notes with
  the measured behaviour (class 1 holds at 44,1/48 kHz, degrades at
  fs <= 32 kHz).
- SII (ANSI S3.5-1997): the equivalent disturbance spectrum level is the
  clause 5.6 maximum of the equivalent masking and internal noise levels,
  not their energy sum; the index for a hearing-impaired listener in
  moderate noise was underestimated by up to 0,042 (0,1841 vs the
  standard's 0,2185 for normal speech in flat 30 dB noise with a flat
  40 dB loss). Confirmed against the official worksheet (=MAX in every
  band) and the R CRAN worked example.
- IEC 60268-3 intermodulation reworked to the clause-exact quantities:
  `modulation_distortion` reports the per-order arithmetic sideband sums
  over the f2 output (14.12.7.2 g-h) instead of one combined RMS;
  `difference_frequency_distortion` references U_2,ref = 2 U_2,f2 and sums
  the third-order products arithmetically (14.12.8.1) instead of halving
  the reference (+6 dB on d2, +3 dB on d3); and
  `total_difference_frequency_distortion` implements 14.12.10.1 directly
  (only the two in-band products over the tone-amplitude sum, standard
  8 kHz / 11,95 kHz tones as defaults) instead of sqrt(d2^2 + d3^2).
- Intermodulation product search windows no longer swallow neighbouring
  components: octave-spaced clean tones read 0 instead of d2 = 1,0, DC
  offsets no longer leak into d3, out-of-band products clamp to
  (0, Nyquist), and the two TDFD products can no longer double-count.
- THD+N/SINAD measured noise over the full Nyquist band: at fs = 192 kHz
  white noise read +7 dB versus the AES17 band-limited value and a DC
  offset was counted as noise; both now pass through the AES17
  measurement-bandwidth chain by default.
- The AES17 standard notch was designed at the nominal Q but applied
  zero-phase (filtfilt squares the response), so the applied quality
  factor was 0,644x nominal (a requested 2,0 acted as 1,29; requests below
  ~1,87 silently fell outside the AES17 [1,2, 3] range). The design Q is
  now compensated by sqrt(1 + sqrt(2)) so the applied response has the
  requested quality factor.
- `thd` returned 0,0 when no harmonic of the fundamental fitted below
  Nyquist (for example a 20 kHz fundamental at fs = 48 kHz); it now raises,
  and captures shorter than 64 samples are rejected.
- THD/SINAD documentation labelled both THD conventions as the
  IEC 60268-3 14.12.2-3 quantity and cited AES17 for SINAD; the R
  convention is now identified as the 14.12.3.2 formula and SINAD as
  derived from the AES17 THD+N (AES17 does not define SINAD).
- Psychoacoustic annoyance combined the weightings as
  N5*sqrt(1 + wS^2 + wFR^2) where Fastl & Zwicker Eq. (16.2) prints
  PA = N5*(1 + sqrt(wS^2 + wFR^2)); every PA with a nonzero
  sharpness/fluctuation/roughness contribution was 13-29 % low, and the
  worked reference value had been hand-computed with the same wrong form.
  The worked tuple now anchors PA = 37,0478.
- ECMA-418-2 roughness omitted the mandatory Clause 5.1.2 5 ms fade-in and
  its calibration signal was synthesized with the carrier (not the overall
  signal) at 60 dB SPL. With both corrected the chain reproduces the
  Clause 7 reference to 0,99990 asper with the tabulated c_R; the former
  "+7,35 % clean-room methodology variance" narrative was wrong and is
  removed everywhere.
- ECMA-418-2 loudness skipped the cross-block-size-group ACF recomputation
  of Clause 6.2.3 (tonal content near the block-size boundaries was
  mis-stated by up to -9,5 %); loudness and tonality now share one full
  Clause 6.2.3 tonal/noise split and report identical N'_tonal. The 1 kHz /
  40 dB calibration computes 0,9845 sone_HMS with the verbatim c_N; the
  residual's origin is documented in the module. The common time grid is
  sized from the 1024-sample stage (no more trailing edge-held samples) and
  the tonality band-range arguments are validated per Formulae 56/57.
- Fluctuation strength transcribed the misprinted Bark constant 0,76e-4 from
  Osses 2016 Eq. (3); the Zwicker-Terhardt formula and the paper's own
  anchors require 0,76e-3. The 47 filter centres now span 50 Hz-13,2 kHz
  (was 491 Hz-20 kHz with 12 duplicate edge bands) and carrier-frequency
  behaviour matches F&Z Fig. 10.5 (C_FS = 0,279, near the paper's 0,2490).
- ISO 532-1 Annex B validation tests had silently skipped since the test
  tree reorganization (broken relative fixtures path behind a skip guard);
  the path is fixed and an in-repo presence assertion prevents a recurrence.
- DIN 45692 Aures/von Bismarck sharpness variants used self-derived
  normalization constants where Formulas (B.1)/(B.2) print the literal
  k = 0,11 (every Aures result was +4,2 % against the published formula);
  the reference sound now lands near, not exactly at, 1 acum
  (0,96/1,02 acum) and is asserted non-circularly.
- ISO 532-1 filterbank tables were mislabelled (Table A.1 is the reference
  section; the per-band deviations and gains are Table A.2), and the
  sone-to-phon mapping documents the reference-program provenance of its
  exact 10/lg 2 factor and 3 phon floor.
- Underwater Francois-Garrison absorption used the Medwin & Clay textbook
  transcription of the boric-acid factor (8.68/c); the original paper prints
  8.86/c and only that value reproduces the paper's own Table IV (the
  transcription biased boric-dominated bands at 0.6-30 kHz by up to 1.7 %).
- ISO 10846-3 indirect method returned out-of-validity results silently:
  `transfer_stiffness_indirect` now computes the per-band transmissibility
  magnitude and emits a `PhonometryWarning` where |T| > 0,1 (Inequality (2):
  DeltaL1,2 < 20 dB, outside the 1 dB / 12 % accuracy of Formula (1)),
  exposes the limit as `TRANSMISSIBILITY_LIMIT`, and documents the
  blocking-mass rigidity criterion 10 lg(m2,eff^2/m2^2) <= 1 dB
  (Inequality (3)) with the Formula (4) effective-mass measurement.
- SDOF clause attributions for ISO 7626-1: the closed-form resonator
  (H = 1/(k - w^2 m + jwc), peak mobility 1/c) was cited as "Annex A", which
  covers matrix impedance/mobility relations; module, tests, docs and
  conformance now cite it as closed form consistent with the Table 1 / 3.1.2
  definitions, and the mobility definition citation is corrected from 3.1 to
  3.1.2.
- Zero-denominator edges in the vibration FRF modules raise an explicit
  ValueError instead of propagating inf/NaN: `transfer_stiffness_direct`
  with a zero input displacement, `transfer_stiffness_level` of a zero
  magnitude, `loss_factor` of a purely imaginary stiffness, and
  `convert_frf` of a zero value through a force-per-motion reciprocal.
- Documentation: `convert_frf`/`MobilityResult.to` reciprocals are the free
  quantities of ISO 7626-1 3.1.4 (blocked matrix quantities do not invert
  element-wise; Table 1 names F/a the effective mass), the ISO 2631-5 input
  record must be conditioned (DC-removed) since the seat-to-spine transfer
  is unity at 0 Hz, and `weighted_acceleration` notes that ISO tables
  tabulate at true one-third-octave centres 10^(n/10), not nominal labels.
- ISO 10848 octave-band single-number Kij averaged the wrong range: the
  one-third-octave 200-1250 Hz mask was reused on octave centres, dropping
  the 125 Hz octave (a +0,5 dB bias per dB/octave of Kij slope); octave
  results now average 125-1000 Hz per Annex A, and `octave_bands()` validates
  that the input groups into whole octave triples.
- EN 12354-2 Formula (3) standardization used the Annex E.3 rounding
  10 lg(V/30); `standardized_impact_level` now applies the exact
  10 lg(0,032 V) form (the E.3 rounding stays documented), removing a
  constant -0,18 dB bias.
- `flanking_element` never applied the mandatory Kij,min floor of EN 12354-1
  Clause 4.4.2 / Formula (29); passing the flanking-element area now clamps
  each path automatically.
- EN 12354-4 `radiated_sound_power` no longer caps R' at 40 dB by default:
  the cap is an Annex G worked-example footnote, not part of Formula (2)/(3)
  (pass `r_prime_cap=40.0` to reproduce Annex G).
- `equivalent_impact_level` warns outside the 100-600 kg/m2 envelope of the
  EN 12354-2 Annex B relation; `structure_borne_power_level` validates the
  loss factor; the EN 12354-5 coupling terms validate source/receiver
  mobilities instead of silently returning NaN/inf;
  `single_number_uncertainty_uncorrelated` validates finiteness of both
  inputs.
- Documentation corrections: the EN 15657 Formula (14) level is the
  reception-plate injected power (not the characteristic source level; the
  EN 12354-5 chain needs the Formula (15)/(17) conversion), the EN 12354-4
  Annex E (E.2a)/(E.2b) branches do not "meet within rounding" (about
  -0,7 dB step for a square side), the `modal_overlap_factor` docstring no
  longer claims an exclusion the code did not apply, and
  `materials/dynamic_stiffness` no longer points to ISO 16251-1 (whose scope
  excludes floating floors).
#### Previously in Unreleased
- Underwater Wenz wind noise was referenced to the historical 20 µPa
  (0.0002 dyn/cm²) pressure while labelled dB re 1 µPa: every wind spectrum
  level (and the ambient composite) was 26.02 dB low and the wind/thermal
  crossover appeared at ~12 kHz instead of ~63 kHz. The rule-of-fives anchor
  is now 25 + 20·lg(20) = 51.02 dB re 1 µPa²/Hz at 1 kHz / 5 kn, matching the
  published Wenz chart; slopes unchanged, figures regenerated.
- Underwater `normal_modes` derives its default depth grid from the physics,
  restricts the eigensolve to the propagating band, discards eigenvalues
  inside the finite-difference error band about cutoff (previously a spurious
  extra mode could appear at under-resolved settings) and warns when a
  retained near-cutoff mode needs a finer grid.
- Underwater `ray_trace` evaluates the sound-speed gradient exactly per
  profile segment instead of smoothing kinks through an interpolated fine
  grid (turning-depth errors of metres on thermocline profiles).
- Underwater documentation accuracy: ISO 17208-2 uncertainty band edges and
  the standard's 16-20 kHz gap, Ainslie-McColm ~10 % agreement caveat at
  domain corners, the inherent Francois-Garrison A3 step at 20 °C, published
  validity domains of the sound-speed equations, wind-speed validity of the
  Wenz law, the paraxial (~±15-20°) validity of the standard PE, and stale
  cross-references; `sound_speed_profile` now evaluates in a single
  vectorised pass.
- ECAC Doc 32 rotorcraft: hemisphere gap-fill now fills the grid first and
  interpolates over all four corners (Eq. 14/15 before Eq. 13), so cells with
  some missing corners keep their measured corners instead of snapping to the
  single nearest bin; nearest-bin ties are compared through dot products
  (well-conditioned near zero angular distance); single-row/column grids are
  handled explicitly; the low-band advisory warning is no longer emitted for
  the standard 10-40 Hz NORAH bands; and the atmospheric docstring states the
  pure-tone choice and its deviation from the guidance's SAE band mapping
  (up to 2.2 dB/km at 8-10 kHz) instead of overclaiming Table 4.
- ECAC Doc 29: behind takeoff ground-roll segments the lateral attenuation and
  installation effect now use the §4.5.5 nearest-end geometry (previously the
  track perpendicular, which zeroed both terms on the extended centreline and
  overpredicted behind-the-runway levels by up to about 10 dB); runway segments
  use the Eq. 4-13b average speed (V = 0 start-of-roll waypoints are now
  accepted); the exposure elevation angle on inclined segments follows the
  equivalent-level-path convention (Fig. 4-6); maximum-level metrics use the
  nearest-end lateral geometry behind/ahead; NPD lookups clamp to the
  recommended 30 m floor (also fixes a crash for receivers exactly under the
  path). Validated against seven branch-covering receptor events of the ECAC
  Doc 29 Vol 3 Part 1 reference workbook.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Twelve domain namespaces: `phonometry.metrology`, `.psychoacoustics`,
  `.hearing`, `.emission`, `.room`, `.materials`, `.building`, `.vibration`,
  `.environmental`, `.aircraft`, `.underwater` and `.electroacoustics`, each a
  curated subpackage usable as `from phonometry import aircraft as air`. The
  flat top-level API is unchanged and remains the primary surface.

### Changed

- The internal package layout is reorganized into the domain subpackages
  above; every pre-3.2 flat module path (for example `phonometry.insulation`,
  `phonometry.underwater_acoustics`) keeps importing for one deprecation
  cycle and warns on attribute access. They are removed in 4.0.

### Deprecated

- The pre-3.2 flat module paths (see Changed). Pickles created with 3.2
  reference the new module paths and will not unpickle under 3.1.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- `air_attenuation()` and `air_attenuation_m()` (with the
  `AtmosphericAbsorptionWarning`) — pure-tone atmospheric absorption coefficient
  α per ISO 9613-1:1993 (Eq. 3–5) from frequency, temperature, humidity and
  pressure; reproduces Table 1 to under 0,4 % and exposes the ISO 354 power
  attenuation coefficient m = α/(10 lg e). `exact_midband=True` snaps onto the
  Table 1 midbands.
- ISO 9613-2:1996 outdoor sound propagation: `outdoor_propagation_attenuation()`
  and `predicted_receiver_level()` with the `OutdoorAttenuation` per-term
  breakdown, plus the individual terms `geometric_divergence()`,
  `atmospheric_absorption()`, `ground_attenuation()` (general 7.3.1),
  `ground_attenuation_alternative()` / `directivity_omega()` (alternative 7.3.2),
  `barrier_attenuation()` with the `Barrier` geometry dataclass, and
  `meteorological_correction()`. `DEFAULT_FREQUENCIES` gives the nominal octave
  bands.
- `task_based_exposure()`, `job_based_exposure()` and `full_day_exposure()`
  (with `Task`, `ExposureResult` and `OccupationalExposureWarning`) — ISO 9612:2009 daily
  noise exposure LEX,8h by the three measurement strategies and the normative
  Annex C uncertainty budget (k = 1,65 one-sided 95 %, the C.6 I(I−1) vs
  C.12 N−1 sampling asymmetry, Table C.4 and the LEX,8h + U upper limit); the
  Annex D/E/F worked examples reproduce to the standard's printed precision.
- Documentation: new **Outdoor Sound Propagation** guide (ISO 9613-1/2, EN + ES),
  an **ISO 9612 occupational exposure** section in the Levels guide, theory and
  API-reference sections, four new figures each (air absorption α(f), the
  per-term attenuation breakdown and the exposure-uncertainty example) and the
  source–barrier–receiver geometry diagram. Conformance report adds seven
  ISO 9613-2 / ISO 9612 checks (41 total).

- `loudness_moore_glasberg()`, `loudness_moore_glasberg_from_spectrum()` and
  `loudness_moore_glasberg_from_third_octave()` with the `MooreGlasbergLoudness`
  result and its `.plot()` — stationary Moore-Glasberg loudness per
  ISO 532-2:2017 (level-dependent roex excitation pattern on the ERB-number/Cam
  scale, compressive specific loudness and binaural inhibition), anchored so a
  1 kHz / 40 dB SPL tone is 1.000 sone.
- `loudness_moore_glasberg_time()` and `MooreGlasbergTimeVaryingLoudness` (with
  `.plot()`) — time-varying Moore-Glasberg-Schlittenlacher loudness per
  ISO 532-3:2023: the short-term S′(t) and long-term S″(t) loudness traces, the
  peak long-term loudness N_max and percentile long-term loudness.
- `loudness_ecma()` and `EcmaLoudness` (with `.plot()`) — Sottek Hearing Model
  loudness per ECMA-418-2:2025 (sone_HMS) on the 53-band Bark_HMS auditory
  front-end; a 1 kHz / 40 dB SPL tone calibrates to ≈ 1 sone_HMS.
- `tonality_ecma()` and `EcmaTonality` (with `.plot()`) — ECMA-418-2:2025
  tonality (tu_HMS) from the autocorrelation of the band signal, with the
  time-dependent tonality T(l), the average specific tonality T′(z) and the
  per-band tonal frequency; a 1 kHz / 40 dB tone calibrates to ≈ 1 tu_HMS.
- `roughness_ecma()` and `EcmaRoughness` (with `.plot()`) — ECMA-418-2:2025
  roughness (asper), a new capability, from the band-envelope modulation
  analysis; the reference 1 kHz carrier 100 %-AM at 70 Hz, 60 dB SPL calibrates
  to ≈ 1 asper.

- One-line canonical `.plot()` method on every public result object —
  `ZwickerLoudness`, `STIResult`, `RoomAcousticsResult`, `DecayCurve`,
  `WeightedRatingResult`, `ImpactRatingResult`, `SoundPowerResult`,
  `ReverberationSoundPowerResult`, `SoundPowerIntensityResult` and
  `IntensityResult` — reproducing each result's documentation figure in a
  single call (`res.plot()`). matplotlib stays a soft dependency: importing
  and computing work without it, and `.plot()` raises a clear `ImportError`
  with `pip install phonometry[plot]` guidance when it is missing. The
  renderers create their own figure when `ax` is `None`, always return the
  Matplotlib `Axes` (an array for multi-panel figures) and never call
  `plt.show()`, so they compose into larger layouts. To feed those
  figures, `WeightedRatingResult` and `ImpactRatingResult` now also carry
  `band_centers`, `measured` and `shifted_reference`, exposing the ISO 717
  measured curve and shifted reference behind each single-number rating.
- `sweep_signal()`, `inverse_filter()`, `impulse_response()`, `mls_signal()`
  and `mls_impulse_response()` — deterministic-excitation impulse-response
  acquisition per ISO 18233:2006 (exponential sine sweep with spectral and
  Farina deconvolution, maximum-length sequences), verified by recovering
  known impulse responses at the correct sample lags.
- `decay_curve()`, `room_parameters()` and `RoomAcousticsResult` — room
  acoustic parameters per ISO 3382-1:2009 / 3382-2:2008 (Schroeder backward
  integration with noise truncation and tail compensation; EDT/T20/T30,
  C50/C80, D50, Ts with dynamic-range validity flags and curvature),
  verified against the exponential-decay closed forms within their JNDs.
- `open_plan_metrics()` and `OpenPlanResult` — open-plan-office spatial
  speech metrics per ISO 3382-3:2012 (spatial decay rate D2,S and Lp,A,S,4m
  from the log-distance regression, distraction distance rD and privacy
  distance rP from the STI-vs-distance line).
- `airborne_insulation()`, `weighted_rating()`, `energy_average_level()`
  and the `AirborneInsulationResult` / `WeightedRatingResult` dataclasses —
  field airborne sound insulation per ISO 16283-1:2014 (D, DnT, R') and
  single-number weighted ratings with C/Ctr per ISO 717-1 (reference-curve
  method), verified against the ISO 717-1 Annex C worked example.
- `impact_insulation()`, `weighted_impact_rating()` and the
  `ImpactInsulationResult` / `ImpactRatingResult` dataclasses — field impact
  sound insulation per ISO 16283-2 (standardized L'nT and normalized L'n from
  the tapping-machine impact level) and single-number weighted impact ratings
  with the CI adaptation term per ISO 717-2 (reference-curve method, octave
  −5 dB rule), verified against the ISO 717-2 Annex C examples (Ln,w = 79,
  CI = −11; octave 54, CI = 0).
- `facade_insulation()` and `FacadeInsulationResult` (with `.plot()`) — field
  façade sound insulation per ISO 16283-3:2016: the level difference D2m from
  the level 2 m in front of the façade, its standardized D2m,nT and normalized
  D2m,n forms, and the apparent element-method sound reduction index R′45°
  (loudspeaker, −1.5 dB) / R′tr,s (road traffic, −3 dB), rated to a single
  number with the ISO 717-1 airborne engine.
- `lab_airborne_insulation()`, `lab_impact_insulation()`,
  `background_correction()` and the `LabAirborneInsulationResult` /
  `LabImpactInsulationResult` dataclasses (with `.plot()`) plus the
  `LabInsulationWarning` — laboratory sound insulation per ISO 10140: the direct
  sound reduction index R (Part 2) and normalized impact level Ln (Part 3) with
  the Sabine absorption area A = 0,16 V/T (Part 4), background-noise correction
  with the 6/15 dB limit-of-measurement rule, and single-number ratings via the
  reused ISO 717-1/2 engines.
- `predicted_airborne_insulation()`, `predicted_impact_insulation()`,
  `junction_vibration_reduction()`, `junction_min_vibration_reduction()`,
  `flanking_path()`, `flanking_element()`, `combine_linings()`,
  `equivalent_impact_level()`, `impact_flanking_correction()`,
  `standardized_impact_level()` and the `AirbornePredictionResult` /
  `ImpactPredictionResult` / `FlankingPath` / `PathContribution` dataclasses —
  building acoustic performance prediction per EN 12354-1/-2:2000 (simplified
  single-number model): the apparent R′w from the direct path and the twelve
  flanking paths of four elements (Ff/Df/Fd each) with the Annex E junction
  vibration reduction index Kij and the Kij,min
  floor, and the apparent L′n,w from the bare-floor equivalent level, covering
  improvement and Table 1 flanking correction. Verified against the EN 12354-1
  Annex H.3 (R′w = 52 dB) and EN 12354-2 Annex E.3 (L′n,w = 45 dB) worked
  examples.
- `band_uncertainty()`, `single_number_uncertainty()`,
  `single_number_uncertainty_uncorrelated()`,
  `maximum_repeatability_standard_deviation()`, `coverage_factor()`,
  `expanded_uncertainty()`, `uncertain_value()`, `combine_uncertainties()`,
  `prediction_input_uncertainty()`, `reduce_by_independent_measurements()`,
  `satisfies_lower_requirement()`, `satisfies_upper_requirement()`, the
  `BandUncertainty` / `UncertainValue` dataclasses and the `COVERAGE_FACTORS`
  mapping — measurement uncertainty in building acoustics per ISO 12999-1:2020:
  the tabulated standard uncertainties for the three measurement situations
  (A/B/C, Tables 1–7 and Annex D), the expanded uncertainty U = k·u with the
  Table 8 coverage factors, and the combination, reduction and conformity rules
  (Annexes A/B/C, one-sided and two-sided).
- `absorption_area()`, `absorption_coefficient()`, `attenuation_from_alpha()`
  and `AbsorptionWarning` — sound absorption in a reverberation room per
  ISO 354:2003 (equivalent absorption area from the empty and with-specimen
  reverberation times via Sabine's equation with the air-attenuation term, and
  the plane-absorber coefficient αs, left unclamped per Clause 3.7), with
  room-volume and sample-area qualification advisories.
- `sound_power_pressure()`, `measurement_positions()`,
  `background_noise_correction()`, `environmental_correction()` and
  `SoundPowerResult` / `SoundPowerWarning` — sound power level from surface
  sound pressure per ISO 3744:2010 (engineering) and ISO 3746:2010 (survey):
  hemisphere and box measurement surfaces, background (K1) and environmental
  (K2) corrections, A-weighted total, directivity index and expanded
  uncertainty.
- `sound_power_reverberation()`, `sound_power_comparison()` and
  `ReverberationSoundPowerResult` — precision-grade sound power in a
  reverberation room per ISO 3741:2010 (direct method with Sabine absorption
  area, Waterhouse boundary correction and C1/C2 meteorological corrections;
  comparison method against a reference sound source), with room-qualification
  advisories.
- `sound_power_intensity()` and `SoundPowerIntensityResult` — sound power by
  sound-intensity scanning per ISO 9614-2:1996 (partial powers over the
  measurement surface, FpI and F+/− field indicators, per-segment
  repeatability and the per-band achieved engineering/survey grade).
- `loudness_zwicker()` / `loudness_zwicker_from_spectrum()` — Zwicker
  loudness per ISO 532-1:2017 (stationary and time-varying), a clean-room
  port of the normative reference program with the full Annex B validation
  set in CI (25 test cases, per-sample tolerance bands).
- `sharpness_din()` — sharpness in acum per DIN 45692:2009 with the Aures
  and von Bismarck variants, verified against the Table A.2 targets.
- `sti_from_impulse_response()`, `stipa()` and `stipa_signal()` — Speech
  Transmission Index per IEC 60268-16 Ed. 5 (indirect and direct STIPA
  methods, Ed. 5 male spectrum, Annex F ratings), verified against the
  standard's weighting-pair and m-mapping vectors and the Schroeder
  closed form.
- `sound_intensity()`, `field_indicators()`, `dynamic_capability_index()` —
  two-microphone p-p sound intensity per IEC 61043 (cross-spectral
  estimator, finite-difference bias correction validated against Table 3)
  with the ISO 9614-1 Annex A field indicators.
- `weighting_filter(..., curve="G")` — G frequency weighting for infrasound
  (ISO 7196:1995), verified against every Table 2 nominal response value.
- `equal_loudness_contour()`, `loudness_level()`, `hearing_threshold()` —
  ISO 226:2023 normal equal-loudness-level contours (Formulae 1-2, Table 1),
  verified against the Annex B tables.
- `tone_to_noise_ratio()` and `prominence_ratio()` — prominent discrete tone
  assessment per ECMA-418-1:2024 (clauses 10-12), including proximate-tone
  combination and the low-frequency truncated band.
- `lden()`, `ldn()`, `composite_rating_level()` — environmental noise
  descriptors per ISO 1996-1:2016 (3.6.4/3.6.5 and clause 6.5).
- `calculate_sensitivity(..., narrowband=True)` — opt-in coherent
  single-frequency (Goertzel) tone estimator that locks to the calibrator
  tone near `frequency` and rejects broadband hum/noise in the reference
  take, which otherwise inflates the RMS and biases the sensitivity by
  `-10*lg(1 + 1/SNR)` (about -0.42 dB at 10 dB SNR). The default keeps the
  legacy broadband-RMS behaviour.
- `decay_curve(..., zero_phase=...)` and `room_parameters(..., zero_phase=...)`
  — optional forward-backward (time-reversed) octave filtering permitted by
  ISO 3382-2:2008 Clause 7.3 NOTE (relaxing B*T > 16 to B*T > 4). It removes
  the octave filter's group delay before the backward integration, roughly
  halving the 125 Hz short-decay T30 bias. Default off (causal).
- `sound_intensity(..., bias_correct=True)` — optional per-bin
  finite-difference correction `(k*dr)/sin(k*dr)` (IEC 61043:1994, 7.3)
  applied to the band and broadband intensity totals so they no longer
  under-read toward `max_valid_frequency`. Default off (legacy totals).
- **STIPA (IEC 60268-16):** `stipa()` now emits a `UserWarning` for
  recordings shorter than the recommended 15 s, where the recovered
  modulation depths (and STI) are biased low.
- `tone_to_noise_ratio()` / `prominence_ratio()` (ECMA-418-1) now warn when
  the FFT resolution is too coarse to resolve the tone band (fewer than
  ~3 bins across the 15 % tone half-width), which biases TNR/PR at low
  frequencies.
- `mls_impulse_response()` (ISO 18233) now warns when the recovered impulse
  response still carries energy at the end of the MLS period, the symptom of
  an impulse response longer than one period aliasing circularly (choose a
  higher MLS order).
- `practical_absorption_coefficient()`, `weighted_absorption()` and
  `absorption_class()` — practical sound-absorption coefficient and the weighted
  rating αw with shape indicators (L/M/H) and class A–E per ISO 11654:1997.
- Impedance-tube absorption, surface impedance and transmission loss
  (`impedance_tube` module) per ISO 10534-1/-2:1998 (standing-wave and
  transfer-function methods) and the four-microphone transmission-loss method of
  ASTM E2611, with the ISO/ASTM speed-of-sound and air-density models.

### Changed

- Library-wide audit: shared input-validation and energy-summation helpers,
  consistent numeric types and a common warning base; the `.plot()` convention
  completed on every public result object; concept-based renames of the public
  API carried through a deprecation cycle; the three overloaded guides split by
  topic; and full EN/ES bilingual documentation with a complete API reference.
- Documentation figures migrated to deterministic, byte-reproducible SVG (with a
  tolerance-based CI check), new explanatory diagrams and Tier-1 animations added.

- `decay_curve()` now returns a `DecayCurve` dataclass (`time`, `level`,
  `band`) with a `.plot()` method instead of a bare `(time, level)` tuple.
  Backward compatible: `time, level = decay_curve(ir, fs)` still unpacks
  because `DecayCurve` iterates as `(time, level)`.
- `lc_peak()` now polyphase-oversamples the C-weighted signal (new
  `oversample` parameter, default 8) before peak detection, recovering the
  true inter-sample peak. Sustained high-frequency tones previously
  under-read by up to ~1.15 dB at fs = 48 kHz (e.g. an 8 kHz tone, 6.0
  samples/cycle); LCpeak now tracks the analytic peak within about +/-0.5 dB.
  Reported LCpeak values shift upward for HF-rich signals; pass
  `oversample=1` for the legacy on-grid behaviour.
- `OctaveFilterBank` / `octavefilter` default `attenuation` raised from 60 to
  72 dB. scipy's `cheby2` pins the equiripple deep-stopband floor at exactly
  `attenuation`, so the former 60 dB default sat 10 dB inside the IEC
  61260-1:2014 class 1 deep-stopband limit; 72 dB makes the default cheby2
  bank class 1 (same +0.400 dB passband margin as `butter`). Numerical
  outputs change for cheby2 users — and for elliptic (`ellip`) banks, which
  consume `attenuation` as their stopband attenuation `rs` — who relied on
  the previous default.
- Weighting-filter `high_accuracy` internal oversample target raised from
  96 to 144 kHz, so fs = 48 kHz now oversamples x3 (was x2). This halves the
  high-frequency residual vs the analytic A/C curves (48 kHz: -1.11 -> -0.44
  dB @16k, -2.10 -> -0.85 dB @20k) and removes the 48k-worse-than-44.1k
  asymmetry. High-accuracy weighting outputs shift for all rates below
  144 kHz (48/96/128 kHz included) — e.g. 96 kHz by +0.86 dB @16k / +1.63 dB
  @20k — always toward the analytic curve.
- Calibrator stability validation updated from IEC 60942:2003 to
  IEC 60942:2017 (Ed. 4): the deviations |max − mean| and |min − mean| are
  each compared against the limit, using the
  frequency-dependent Table 2 class 1 limits (0.07 dB in 160 Hz - 1.25 kHz);
  `calculate_sensitivity()` gains a `frequency` parameter.
- `ln_levels()` now discards 5*tau (was 2*tau) of the time-weighting
  integrator attack before computing the percentiles. At 2*tau the F
  integrator is only 86 % settled, so the leading ramp dragged the low
  percentiles down (~0.15 dB L10-L90 spread on a steady 2 s tone); 5*tau
  cuts that ~12x and matches the skip already used by the calibration
  stability check. Percentile values on short records shift slightly.

### Fixed

- **Sharpness (DIN 45692):** the informative Aures and von Bismarck variants
  are now anchored to exactly 1.00 acum on the clause 6 reference sound via
  per-variant normalization constants (previously 0.959 / 1.019 from a
  shared hard-coded factor).
- **Loudness (ISO 532-1):** N5/N10 percentiles are now computed on the
  full-rate 2000 Hz weighted-loudness series instead of the 4x-decimated
  500 Hz trace, removing an up-to-3% decimation-phase ambiguity. The
  500 Hz `time`/`loudness_vs_time` output and Nmax are unchanged.
- **Room acoustics (ISO 3382):** T20/T30 reverberation-time validity flags
  now require 46 dB / 54 dB of dynamic range (was 35 dB / 45 dB) to
  absorb the positive bias of the tail compensation and keep a flagged-valid
  decay time within the 5% JND (ISO 3382-2 Table A.1).
- **Impulse-response (ISO 18233):** `impulse_response(method="farina")` now
  raises `ValueError` when handed a zero-padded reference sweep (which
  silently produced a wrong inverse filter) instead of returning garbage;
  pass the unpadded sweep or use `method="spectral"`.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-07-06

### ⚠️ Breaking changes

- **The library is now `phonometry`** (formerly `PyOctaveBand`). Install with
  `pip install phonometry` and `import phonometry`. The API is unchanged — a
  plain rename of the import is a complete migration. The final
  `PyOctaveBand 2.1.0` release on PyPI is a transition stub that depends on
  `phonometry` and re-exports it under the old `pyoctaveband` module name with
  a `DeprecationWarning`, so `pip install -U PyOctaveBand` keeps existing code
  working. The last state under the old name is preserved in the locked
  [`pyoctaveband-v2`](https://github.com/jmrplens/phonometry/tree/pyoctaveband-v2) branch.
- **Python >= 3.13 required** (was >= 3.11). CI now tests 3.13 and 3.14
  (3.15 will be added once it reaches a stable release).

### Added

- `lc_peak()` — C-weighted peak level (IEC 61672-1 §5.13), verified against
  the Table 5 one-cycle/half-cycle tone-burst responses.
- `sel()` — sound exposure level (SEL/LAE), with class 1 conformance tests for
  the Table 4 LAE tone-burst column.
- `sound_exposure()` and `lex_8h()` — occupational noise dose (Pa²·h and
  normalized 8 h exposure level, IEC 61252).
- `calculate_sensitivity(..., validate=True)` — calibration-tone stability
  validation per IEC 60942 (short-term level fluctuation, class 1 limit),
  emitting `CalibrationWarning` on unstable or too-short recordings.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-06

### ⚠️ Numerical behavior changes

Results differ from 1.2.x for the following cases — all of them bring the
output in line with the governing standards:

- **Chebyshev II banks** now place their −3 dB points on the ANSI S1.11 band
  edges. Previously the band edges received the full stopband `attenuation`
  (−60 dB by default), underestimating broadband band levels by ~2.8 dB
  vs Butterworth. ([#58](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/58))
- **Bessel banks** are designed with `norm="mag"`: −3 dB lands on the band
  edges (previously ~−10 dB, a ~2.2 dB broadband error). ([#58](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/58))
- **A/C frequency weighting** defaults to `high_accuracy=True`: the filter is
  designed and run at an internally oversampled rate (≥ 96 kHz), keeping the
  response within IEC 61672-1 class 1 tolerances up to 16 kHz at common audio
  rates (previously −2.67 dB at 12.5 kHz for fs = 48 kHz, outside class 1).
  Stateful weighting keeps the legacy design; `high_accuracy=True` with
  `stateful=True` raises. ([#58](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/58))

### Added

- `verify_filter_class()`: verify a bank against the IEC 61260-1:2014
  class 1/2 acceptance limits (Table 1, transcribed from the official text)
  with per-band margins; `class_limits()` exposes the limit curves. ([#64](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/64))
- Standards-compliance test layer transcribed from the official texts:
  IEC 61672-1:2013 Table 4 tone-burst suite (F/S, 1 s to 1 ms) and Table 3
  full 34-frequency A/C weighting sweep within class 1 limits. ([#64](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/64))
- `CITATION.cff` and `.zenodo.json` metadata; Codecov coverage upload and
  quality badges. ([#64](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/64))
- Documentation: four new auto-generated figures (group delay, IEC
  toneburst, block continuity, IEC class mask), Mermaid diagrams, more
  equations, and a full SEO/GEO layer for the docs site (JSON-LD,
  llms.txt, AI-crawler opt-in, WCAG2AA gates). ([#66](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/66))
- `leq()`, `laeq()` and `ln_levels()` (L10/L50/L90 statistical levels from the
  Fast/Slow/Impulse envelope, with optional A/C weighting). ([#60](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/60))
- `OctaveFilterBank.spectrogram()`: short-time band levels (bands × frames),
  multichannel-aware, with bounded-memory windowing. ([#60](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/60))
- `zero_phase=True` option in `OctaveFilterBank.filter()` and `spectrogram()`:
  forward-backward filtering (no group delay) for offline analysis. ([#60](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/60))
- `TimeWeighting` stateful class for block processing (block outputs match a
  single continuous call exactly). ([#60](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/60))
- `weighting_filter(..., high_accuracy=...)` and
  `WeightingFilter(..., high_accuracy=...)` parameter. ([#58](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/58))
- PEP 561 `py.typed` marker: downstream type checkers now receive the
  library's strict annotations.
- Documentation website (English/Español) at
  https://jmrplens.github.io/PyOctaveBand/ with theme-aware auto-generated
  figures, plus topic pages under `docs/`. ([#61](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/61))

### Fixed

- Integer input (e.g. int16 audio from `scipy.io.wavfile.read`) no longer
  overflows silently: `time_weighting` returned negative energies and
  `calculate_sensitivity` produced factors ~315× off. All inputs are converted
  to float64. ([#58](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/58))
- `cheby2` with `attenuation <= 3.01 dB` now raises instead of silently
  producing NaN coefficients. ([#58](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/58))
- `zero_phase` no longer crashes on heavily decimated bands shorter than the
  default `sosfiltfilt` padding. ([#60](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/60))
- The weighting-curves documentation figure measured a truncated impulse
  response through the resampling path (~2.4 dB low); the measurement is now
  guarded by tests. ([#63](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/63))

### Performance

- `octavefilter()` reuses cached filter-bank designs across calls (~3.3×
  faster in loops). ([#59](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/59))
- `numba` and `matplotlib` are optional extras (`[perf]`, `[plot]`, `[full]`);
  a pure-Python impulse kernel and lazy plotting imports keep full
  functionality without them. ([#59](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/59))

## [1.2.3] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Importing the package no longer forces the matplotlib Agg backend. ([#53](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/53))

## [1.2.2] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Configurable time weighting initial state (`initial_state`: `'zero'`,
  `'first'`, scalar or per-channel array). ([#49](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/49))

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- IEC 61260-1 nominal frequency labels (`nominal=True`). ([#46](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/46))

## [1.1.5] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- Overloads, `WeightingFilter` multichannel state, version sync and SonarCloud
  CI. ([#45](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/45))

## [1.1.4] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- Stateful block-wise processing for `OctaveFilterBank` and
  `WeightingFilter`. ([#42](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/42))
- macOS and Windows in the CI test matrix. ([#40](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/40))

## [1.1.1] - 2026-01-07

### Changed

- DSP core enhancements: vectorization, IEC standards alignment and
  precision. ([#35](https://github.com/jmrplens/PyOctaveBand/pull/35))

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-06
