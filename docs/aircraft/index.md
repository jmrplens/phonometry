# Aircraft noise

Aircraft are noise sources important enough to have their own internationally
negotiated metrics, each fixed to the last decimal by a certification
framework. The four pages of this section implement those frameworks, and
they share a common anatomy: a rigorously standardised **source descriptor**,
plus standardised **propagation adjustments** that place the source at a
receiver.

[Aircraft noise: Effective Perceived Noise Level](aircraft-noise.md)
covers fixed-wing certification. The **EPNL** of ICAO Annex 16 condenses a
one-third-octave time history of a flyover into a single EPNdB value through
perceived noisiness, a tone correction and a duration correction; the page
adds the IEC 61265 measurement-system verifier and the SAE ARP 5534
atmospheric absorption used in the certification chain.
[Airport Noise (ECAC Doc 29)](airport-noise.md) picks the
aeroplane up from there: the noise-power-distance tables, the per-segment
corrections of a flight path (impedance, lateral attenuation, engine
installation, duration, noise fraction and start-of-roll directivity) and the
single-event contour over a ground grid.

[Rotorcraft noise: the hemisphere method](rotorcraft-noise.md)
covers helicopters, whose strong directivity defeats a single-number source
level. ECAC Doc 32 instead describes the source as a **noise hemisphere**
(band levels on a grid of emission angles at a 60 m reference distance),
propagates each ray with spherical spreading, atmospheric absorption and the
Chien-Soroka ground effect, interpolates between the measured flight
conditions along the track, and integrates the received history into the
single-event SEL, LASmax and EPNL and their ground-grid contours.

[The ANP fleet database](anp-fleet.md) closes the loop on
the two above: the noise-power-distance tables and default trajectories EASA and
EUROCONTROL publish for real aircraft types, ready to feed the Doc 29 chain
without writing a table by hand.

The shared physics connects outward: atmospheric absorption comes from the
same ISO 9613-1 model as
[Outdoor Sound Propagation](../environment/propagation/outdoor-propagation.md), and the
same type-testing logic governs
[Wind-turbine noise](../environment/sources/wind-turbine-noise.md),
which is filed with the other environmental sources: its IEC 61400-11 apparent
sound power level and tonal-audibility chain answer the same question for a
source that is not an aircraft. That tonality test is in turn a cousin of the
methods in [Psychoacoustics](../perception/psychoacoustics/index.md).
