Spherical-wave ground effect and advanced barrier diffraction.

This module extends the tabulated ground and barrier terms of ISO 9613-2 (see
:mod:`phonometry.environmental.outdoor_propagation`) with the underlying wave
acoustics: the spherical-wave reflection coefficient of a finite-impedance
ground and the wave-theoretic diffraction of a screen, both in a homogeneous
(non-refracting, non-turbulent) atmosphere.

Ground effect (Weyl-Van der Pol)
--------------------------------
The sound field of a point source above a locally reacting ground is the sum of
a direct wave and a reflected wave weighted by the spherical-wave reflection
coefficient ``Q`` (Attenborough & Van Renterghem, *Predicting Outdoor Sound*
2e, 2021, Eq. (2.40a); Salomons, *Computational Atmospheric Acoustics*, 2001,
Eq. (3.2))::

    p = e^{ikR1}/(4 pi R1) + Q e^{ikR2}/(4 pi R2)

with ``R1`` the source-receiver distance, ``R2`` the image-source distance and
(Attenborough Eq. (2.40c) / Salomons Eq. (D.58))::

    Q  = Rp + (1 - Rp) F(w)
    Rp = (Z cos(theta) - 1) / (Z cos(theta) + 1)        (Salomons Eq. (D.59))
    F(w) = 1 + i sqrt(pi) w exp(-w^2) erfc(-i w)         (Salomons Eq. (D.60))
    w  = sqrt(i k R2 / 2) (cos(theta) + 1/Z)             (Salomons Eq. (D.57))

Here ``Z`` is the normalized (by ``rho c``) surface impedance of the ground,
``theta`` is the angle of incidence from the ground normal
(``cos(theta) = (hs + hr)/R2``) and ``F(w)`` is the boundary-loss factor written
through the scaled complementary error function ``exp(-w^2) erfc(-i w)``, i.e.
the Faddeeva function :func:`scipy.special.wofz`. The relative sound level (the
"excess attenuation", dB re free field) is (Salomons Eq. (3.4))::

    dL = 20 lg| 1 + Q (R1/R2) exp(i k (R2 - R1)) |

Limits reproduced by the implementation: an acoustically hard ground
(``|Z| -> inf``) gives ``Rp -> 1``, so ``(1 - Rp) -> 0`` and ``Q -> 1``
regardless of the boundary loss (the ground wave vanishes), and ``dL`` reaches
``+6 dB`` in phase (Salomons Sec. 3.4); at grazing incidence
(``hs, hr -> 0``, ``cos(theta) -> 0``) ``Rp -> -1``; and as the range grows
(``R2 -> inf``) ``|w| -> inf`` and ``F -> 0``. The ground impedance is taken in
the ``e^{-i omega t}`` time convention of Salomons, in which a passive ground
has ``Im(Z) > 0``; it may be supplied directly or derived from the porous
models of :mod:`phonometry.materials`
(:func:`~phonometry.materials.delany_bazley` / :func:`~phonometry.materials.miki`),
which model a semi-infinite porous ground whose surface impedance equals the
characteristic impedance of the medium. The materials domain works in the
opposite ``e^{+j omega t}`` convention (``Im(Z) < 0`` for a passive medium), so
any impedance obtained from a porous model is conjugated internally before it
enters the formulas above.

Barrier diffraction
-------------------
Three levels of screening beyond the ISO 9613-2 ``Dz`` term are provided:

* the Kurze-Anderson closed form in the Fresnel number ``N`` (Bies, Hansen &
  Howard, *Engineering Noise Control* 5e, 2017, Eq. (5.138); Kurze & Anderson,
  1971)::

      Delta = 5 + 20 lg( sqrt(2 pi N) / tanh(sqrt(2 pi N)) )

  which tends to ``5 dB`` at ``N -> 0`` and stays within about 1.5 dB of
  Maekawa's point-source curve for all ``N`` (a very good fit for ``N > 0.5``);

* the wave-theoretic insertion loss of a rigid thin screen (half-plane), the
  flat-wedge limit of the MacDonald / Hadden & Pierce solution
  (Attenborough Eqs. (9.19)-(9.20)), obtained from the auxiliary Fresnel
  functions and correctly giving ``6 dB`` at the shadow boundary (the field is
  halved);

* the coherent barrier-on-ground model that combines the four source-image /
  receiver-image diffracted paths with the spherical-wave reflection
  coefficient ``Q`` above (Attenborough Ch. 9; Bies Sec. 5.3.5), which shows the
  ground-barrier interference structure a purely energetic sum cannot.

Thick barriers (or two parallel thin screens) are handled by the double-edge
Fresnel number ``N = (2/lambda)(A + B + e - d)`` (Bies Eq. (5.157)).

      (:func:`spherical_reflection_coefficient`); the field without the barrier
      is the two-ray ground field. This exposes the ground-barrier interference
      structure (Attenborough Ch. 9; Bies Sec. 5.3.5). As a first-order
      simplification a single ``Q`` (evaluated over the overall
      source-receiver geometry) weights every bounce rather than a separate
      coefficient per image path; the model is coherent and reciprocal but not
      a full boundary-element solution.
