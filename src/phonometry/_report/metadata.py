"""Test-report metadata for the ISO 717 accredited-laboratory fiche.

:class:`ReportMetadata` is the shared, frozen container of the descriptive
fields an accredited sound-insulation report carries around the ISO 717 rating:
the specimen, the client, the room and climatic conditions, the laboratory
identity and, optionally, the requirement the result is checked against. It is
passed to a rating result's ``report(..., metadata=...)`` method; every field is
optional and only the supplied ones are rendered, so the same object drives both
a full accredited fiche and a lightweight prediction fiche.

    """Descriptive metadata for the accredited ISO 717 report fiche.

    All fields are optional (default ``None``); the report renders only the
    fields that are supplied, so a partially populated instance is valid. The
    numeric fields are validated on construction by physical range: the
    dimension, mass, volume and pressure fields must be finite and strictly
    positive; the temperature and requirement fields need only be finite (0
    degrees Celsius or below is a valid test condition, and a programme-loudness
    target in LUFS is negative); and the relative-humidity fields must lie
    within 0..100 %. A violation raises :class:`ValueError`.

    :ivar specimen: Specimen description printed in the header (the tested
        element, e.g. ``"200 mm concrete wall"``).
    :ivar client: Client the test was carried out for.
    :ivar mounted_by: Who mounted the specimen in the test opening.
    :ivar manufacturer: Manufacturer of the tested element.
    :ivar area: Specimen area ``S``, in m^2 (the free test opening area).
    :ivar mass_per_area: Measured mass per unit area, in kg/m^2.
    :ivar source_volume: Source-room volume, in m^3.
    :ivar receiving_volume: Receiving-room volume, in m^3.
    :ivar room_volume: Volume of the single room under test, in m^3. Room
        acoustics (ISO 3382-1/-2) characterises one enclosure rather than a
        source/receiving pair, and ISO 3382-2:2008 Clause 9 requires the room
        volume to be reported; the room-acoustics fiche prints it in the
        header. Distinct from the ``source_volume``/``receiving_volume`` pair,
        which describe a sound-transmission measurement.
    :ivar source_positions: Number of source (loudspeaker/omnidirectional)
        positions used in the measurement, an integer (ISO 3382-1:2009 Table 1
        and ISO 3382-2:2008 Clause 8 require reporting the number of source
        positions). Printed by the room-acoustics fiche.
    :ivar receiver_positions: Number of microphone (receiver) positions used,
        an integer (ISO 3382-1:2009 Table 1 and ISO 3382-2:2008 Clause 8
        require reporting the number of microphone positions). Printed by the
        room-acoustics fiche.
    :ivar temperature: Air temperature during the test, in degrees Celsius (a
        single representative value; use the per-room fields below when the
        source and receiving rooms are reported separately).
    :ivar relative_humidity: Relative humidity during the test, in %.
    :ivar source_temperature: Source-room air temperature, in degrees Celsius.
    :ivar source_relative_humidity: Source-room relative humidity, in %.
    :ivar receiving_temperature: Receiving-room air temperature, in degrees
        Celsius.
    :ivar receiving_relative_humidity: Receiving-room relative humidity, in %.
    :ivar pressure: Ambient (static) air pressure during the test, in kPa.
    :ivar test_room: Test-room / facility identification.
    :ivar instrumentation: Identification and class of the instrumentation used
        (manufacturer, model, serial number), as free text. The occupational
        noise-exposure fiche prints it for ISO 9612:2009 Clause 15 c; when it
        is not supplied that fiche falls back to the result's own instrument
        class.
    :ivar calibration: Calibration traceability, as free text (calibrator,
        date and result of the most recent verification, the before/after
        field checks). Printed by the occupational noise-exposure fiche
        (ISO 9612:2009 Clause 15 c).
    :ivar tube_diameter: Impedance-tube inner diameter ``d`` (circular tube) or
        maximum lateral dimension (rectangular tube), in metres. Printed by the
        impedance-tube fiche (ISO 10534-2), where it fixes the upper plane-wave
        cut-on frequency.
    :ivar mic_spacing: Microphone spacing ``s`` between the two measurement
        positions of the impedance tube, in metres. Printed by the
        impedance-tube fiche (ISO 10534-2), where it bounds the working
        frequency range.
    :ivar thickness: Specimen thickness under the applied static load, in
        metres. Printed by the dynamic-stiffness fiche (EN 29052-1 /
        ISO 9052-1), where EN 29052-1:1992 Clause 9 b) requires reporting the
        thickness of the resilient layer under load; it is shown in millimetres.
    :ivar mounting: Mounting condition of the specimen (e.g. the ISO 10140-1
        mounting code or a short description).
    :ivar measurement_standard: Measurement standard the spectrum was obtained
        under (e.g. ``"ISO 10140-2"`` or ``"ISO 16283-1"``); it forms the
        report's standard-basis line together with the ISO 717 rating part.
    :ivar test_date: Date of the test, as a free-form string.
    :ivar laboratory: Testing laboratory / institute name (footer).
    :ivar operator: Operator who carried out the test (footer signature line).
    :ivar report_id: Report / test number (footer).
    :ivar requirement: Target single-number value the verdict row compares the
        rating against, expressed in the rating's own unit (e.g. dB, a
        dimensionless absorption coefficient, sone, or a programme-loudness
        level in LUFS). It need only be finite (a loudness target in LUFS is
        negative), so its sign is not constrained. The pass direction is
        defined by each rating's ``report`` method: quantities where more is
        better (airborne insulation, absorption) pass at or above the
        requirement, and quantities where less is better (impact level,
        loudness, aircraft noise) pass at or below it; the programme-loudness
        fiche reads it as the target level and passes within a tolerance.
    :ivar required_class: Target performance-class index for a class-compliance
        verdict (the IEC 61260-1 filter fiche): ``0``, ``1`` or ``2``, where
        class 0 is the strictest. When supplied, the fiche's verdict passes if
        the achieved overall class is at least as strict as this class (a
        smaller or equal class index). ``None`` (the default) prints no verdict
        row.
    :ivar notes: Free-form remarks printed in the footer.
    :raises ValueError: If a supplied dimension/mass/volume/pressure is not
        finite and strictly positive, a temperature or requirement is not
        finite, a relative humidity is outside 0..100 %, or a required class is
        not one of 0, 1, 2, or a position count is not a finite, positive
        integer.
