r"""What every sound-power method has in common: the A-weighting band corrections
of ISO 3744:2010 Annex E, the reference area, the accuracy-grade vocabulary
and the qualification warning.

Each determination method carries its own standard and its own module (the
enveloping surface of ISO 3744/3746, the anechoic room of ISO 3745, the
reverberation room of ISO 3741, the intensity scanning of ISO 9614-2/-3), yet
they meet in the last step: the band sound power levels are combined into an
A-weighted total with the band corrections :math:`C_k` tabulated in ISO
3744:2010 Annex E (Tables E.1/E.2),

.. math::

   L_{W\mathrm{A}} = 10 \log_{10}\!\left[ \sum_k 10^{0.1 (L_{Wk} + C_k)} \right]
   \tag{Eq. E.1}

and the other standards adopt that same table by reference for their own
A-weighted totals (ISO 3741:2010 Annex F Eq. F.2, ISO 3745:2012 Annex C
Eq. C.1, ISO 9614-2:1996 clause 10.6 b). One table, transcribed once.

The radiation-impedance correction :math:`C_2` that carries a band level to
the reference meteorological conditions is shared the same way. ISO 3741:2010
clause 9.1.4 and ISO 3747:2010 Annex C print the same expression,

.. math::

   C_2 = -10 \log_{10}\frac{p_\mathrm{s}}{p_{\mathrm{s},0}}
   + 15 \log_{10}\frac{273{,}15 + \theta}{\theta_1},
   \qquad p_{\mathrm{s},0} = 101{,}325\ \mathrm{kPa},
   \quad \theta_1 = 296\ \mathrm{K}

digit for digit, so the guard on the two meteorological inputs and the
correction itself live here once.

The single event time-integrated levels of the sound energy determinations
meet here too: ISO 3744:2010 Eq. (19)/(20), ISO 3746:2010 Eq. (16)/(17) and
ISO 3741:2010 Eq. (22)/(23) are one pair of equations printed three times,
the energy mean of :math:`N_\mathrm{e}` events measured one at a time and
the :math:`-10 \log_{10} N_\mathrm{e}` of one measurement that encompasses
them all, so :func:`_single_event_mean` is transcribed once and the method
modules call it.

The reference area :math:`S_0 = 1` m^2 of the :math:`10 \log_{10}(S/S_0)`
surface term, the two accuracy grades the methods share (``'engineering'``,
grade 2 of ISO 3744 and ISO 9614-2, and ``'survey'``, grade 3 of ISO 3746 and
ISO 9614-2) and the warning class that every method raises when a
qualification limit is only just met are here for the same reason: the method
modules import them downward from a single definition, and none of them has to
import another method to get them.
