"""Speech intelligibility: the SII of ANSI S3.5 and the STI of IEC 60268-16.

Two ways of asking the same question - how much of the speech survives the
room and the noise. ANSI S3.5-1997 answers it band by band, so its four
procedures (critical band, equally contributing critical band, one-third
octave, octave) each need their band importance function, their worked
example from the working group and the exact index the example returns;
IEC 60268-16 answers it through the modulation transfer function, so its
Annex M example is a full 7x14 MTF matrix with the MTI and STI it yields.

# CB_1.TST and ECB_1.TST are NOT two independent oracles. They coincide to

# bands 3 to 19 and the two alternative importance functions select the same
# physical bands. The two extra critical bands below 300 Hz that only the
# critical-band procedure has do not perturb the weighted bands: their masker
# is the input's 10 dB noise line, and its upward spread arrives at the first
# weighted band at roughly 1e-19 of the local masking energy, under double
# precision. (In the lowest shared band the same contribution is 5e-2 and does
# matter, but that band carries zero weight in both alternative functions.)
# The eight official cases therefore carry seven independent confirmations,
# not eight; the pair is still worth running, because a wrong band mapping in
# either procedure would break the coincidence.

# Speech transmission index - IEC 60268-16 Annex M, Table M.1 "Example
# calculation" (Ed.4, 2011, printed pp. 64-66): a measured STI adjusted to
# simulate occupancy noise and a different speech level. The annex walks four
# numbered steps and prints every intermediate, so each row below is one
# printed row of that table, transcribed verbatim. The one row two steps
# print differently, the reception-threshold intensity at 250 Hz, is noted
# where it is defined.
#
#   step 1  the signal and background-noise octave-band levels present during
#           the measurement, and the MTF matrix measured with the noise,
#           masking and threshold in it (rows are the 14 modulation
#           frequencies 0,63 Hz to 12,5 Hz, columns the 7 octave bands 125 Hz
#           to 8 kHz);
#   step 2  the same correction the forward chain applies, divided out, which
#           leaves the transmission channel alone;
#   step 3  the correction of the operational speech and occupancy-noise
#           levels, applied;
#   step 4  the A.5.4 to A.5.6 processing into effective SNRs, band MTIs and
#           the STI.
#
# Two scale conventions of the printed table matter when these rows are read
# against a computed quantity, and both are recorded in docs/ERRATA.md. The
# combined squared sound pressure I_k is tabulated in units of
# IEC60268_16_ANNEX_M_INTENSITY_SCALE (a row labelled "MPa2"), while
# I_am,k and I_rt,k in the same sum are tabulated unscaled; and the auditory
# masking factor has no value in the 125 Hz band, which has no band below it
# to be masked by, where the table prints "not applicable" and these rows
# carry None.
