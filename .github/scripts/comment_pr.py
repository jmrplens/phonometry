"""Assemble the PR comment body: what moved, not the whole report.

The comment used to be the entire conformance report, all 554 rows of it,
posted again on every run. Measured on #645 that body was 103 954 characters,
against a documented API maximum of 65 536 - it went through because GitHub
appears to enforce the limit on the compressed payload, and a highly repetitive
Markdown table compresses extremely well. That is undocumented headroom, and a
reviewer scrolling 554 unchanged rows to find the two that moved was paying for
it either way.

So the comment answers one question: **what moved.** It joins the committed
``docs/conformance.json`` at this head against the same file on the base branch
and reports verdict changes, new checks, removed checks, renames and numeric
moves - plus, unconditionally, the checks sitting closest to their published
limit, which is the standing metrology question and the one 554 static rows
never surfaced.

Two consequences worth stating. This runs no checks: the ``conformance`` job has
already failed the pull request if the committed artefact is stale, so a
comment built from committed files cannot be reading numbers nobody verified.
And it needs the base commit, so the workflow must fetch it - a checkout at the
default depth has only the merge commit, and a missing baseline degrades to
totals only rather than failing.

The full report is linked rather than pasted. A blob at the head SHA is a
permalink, renders as a table on github.com, and needs no login on a public
repo - which a workflow artefact, being a zip behind an authenticated download
that expires after 90 days, is not.
