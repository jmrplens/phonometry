Two-microphone (p-p) sound intensity per IEC 61043:1994 and the
ISO 9614-1:1993 field indicators.

A p-p probe holds two pressure microphones a fixed distance `spacing`
(dr) apart. The mean of the two pressures is taken as the sound pressure
at the probe reference point, while the pressure differential is used to
derive the particle velocity component along the probe axis
(IEC 61043:1994, definition 3.2):

```text
p(t) = (p1(t) + p2(t)) / 2
u(t) = -(1 / (rho * dr)) * integral of (p2(t) - p1(t)) dt
I    = < p(t) * u(t) >          (time average)
```

For stationary signals the time-averaged intensity reduces to the
imaginary part of the one-sided cross spectrum G12 of the two microphone
pressures (the frequency-domain form of the same finite-difference
estimator):

```text
I(f) = -Im{G12(f)} / (2 * pi * f * rho * dr)
```

The finite-difference gradient underestimates the true plane-wave
intensity by the factor `sin(k*dr) / (k*dr)` with `k = 2*pi*f/c`;
IEC 61043:1994 clause 7.3 specifies the probe intensity response with
exactly this argument (`Ff = dr * f * 2 * pi / c`) and Table 3 lists
the resulting nominal response (e.g. -10,5 dB at 6,3 kHz for a 25 mm
separation). Below `f = 0,1 * c / dr` (k*dr \< 0,63) the bias stays
under about 0,3 dB (factor >= 0,935).

Field indicators F2 (surface pressure-intensity), F3 (negative partial
power) and F4 (field non-uniformity) follow ISO 9614-1:1993 Annex A
(normative), equations (A.3)-(A.9). The dynamic capability index is
`Ld = delta_pI0 - K` (ISO 9614-1 clause 3.12, equation (10)); the
instrument is adequate for a measurement when `Ld > F2` (criterion 1,
Annex B equation (B.1)).

## dynamic_capability_index

```python
dynamic_capability_index(
    pressure_residual_intensity_index: float,
    bias_error_factor: float = 10.0,
) -> float
```

Dynamic capability index Ld (ISO 9614-1:1993, clause 3.12).

`Ld = delta_pI0 - K` (equation (10)), where `delta_pI0` is the
instrument pressure-residual intensity index (clause 3.11, equation
(9); determined per IEC 61043:1994, which requires the Table 2
minima per class) and `K` the bias error factor of Table 1: 10 dB
for precision (grade 1) and engineering (grade 2) measurements, 7 dB
for survey (grade 3). The measurement arrangement is adequate when
`Ld > F2` (criterion 1, Annex B equation (B.1)).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `pressure_residual_intensity_index` | delta_pI0 in decibels. |
| `bias_error_factor` | K in decibels (default 10,0). |

**Returns:** Ld in decibels.

## field_indicators

```python
field_indicators(
    pressure_levels: List[float] | np.ndarray,
    normal_intensity: List[float] | np.ndarray,
) -> FieldIndicators
```

ISO 9614-1:1993 Annex A field indicators F2, F3 and F4.

Given the sound pressure level `Lpi` (dB) and the signed normal
sound intensity `Ini` (W/m^2) measured at each of the N discrete
positions on the measurement surface:

- F2 = Lp - L|In| (equation (A.3)), with the surface pressure level
  from equation (A.4) and the level of the mean magnitude of the
  normal intensity from equation (A.5);
- F3 = Lp - LIn (equation (A.6)), with the algebraic surface
  intensity level from equation (A.7);
- F4 = (1/|mean In|) * sqrt(sum((Ini - mean In)^2) / (N - 1))
  (equations (A.8)-(A.9)).

If the algebraic mean intensity is not positive the test conditions
do not satisfy ISO 9614-1 in that band (clause A.2.3) and a
`ValueError` is raised.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `pressure_levels` | Lpi at each position, in decibels. |
| `normal_intensity` | Signed normal intensity Ini at each position, in W/m^2. |

**Returns:** [`FieldIndicators`](/phonometry/reference/api/power/intensity/#fieldindicators).

## FieldIndicators

```python
FieldIndicators(f2: float, f3: float, f4: float)
```

ISO 9614-1:1993 Annex A field indicators over a measurement surface.

`f2` is the surface pressure-intensity indicator (equation (A.3)),
`f3` the negative partial power indicator (equation (A.6)) and
`f4` the field non-uniformity indicator (equation (A.8)).
`f3 - f2 > 0` reveals negative partial power flowing through parts
of the surface. The instrument's dynamic capability index must
satisfy `Ld > f2` (criterion 1, equation (B.1)); the number of
positions N must satisfy `N > C * f4**2` (criterion 2, equation
(B.2)).

## IntensityResult

```python
IntensityResult(
    frequency: np.ndarray | None,
    intensity: np.ndarray | None,
    intensity_level: np.ndarray | None,
    pressure_level: np.ndarray | None,
    pressure_intensity_index: np.ndarray | None,
    direction: np.ndarray | None,
    bias_correction: np.ndarray | None,
    total_intensity: float,
    total_intensity_level: float,
    total_pressure_level: float,
    total_pressure_intensity_index: float,
    total_direction: int,
    max_valid_frequency: float,
)
```

Result of a p-p sound intensity measurement.

Per-band arrays are `None` unless a band `fraction` was requested.
`intensity` is signed (positive along the probe axis, from
microphone 1 towards microphone 2); `intensity_level` is computed
from the magnitude, `10*lg(|I|/1e-12)` dB, with the sign reported
separately in `direction` (+1/-1). `pressure_intensity_index` is
`Lp - LI` (the single-position form of the ISO 9614-1:1993 F2
indicator, equation (A.3)). `bias_correction` is the multiplicative
factor `(k*dr)/sin(k*dr)` compensating the finite-difference
underestimation at each band centre (IEC 61043:1994, 7.3); it is NaN
at and beyond the first null `k*dr >= pi`. `max_valid_frequency`
is the usable-bandwidth bound `0,1*c/spacing` (bias \< ~0,3 dB).

Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.

### IntensityResult.plot()

```python
IntensityResult.plot(ax: Axes | None = None, **kwargs: Any) -> Axes
```

Plot Lp vs LI per band with the pressure-intensity index.

Requires per-band data (call `sound_intensity(..., fraction=...)`)
and matplotlib (`pip install phonometry[plot]`); returns the
`Axes`.

## sound_intensity

```python
sound_intensity(
    p1: List[float] | np.ndarray,
    p2: List[float] | np.ndarray,
    fs: int,
    spacing: float,
    rho: float = 1.204,
    c: float = 343.0,
    fraction: int | None = None,
    limits: List[float] | None = None,
    bias_correct: bool = False,
) -> IntensityResult
```

Sound intensity from a two-microphone (p-p) probe (IEC 61043:1994).

The one-sided cross spectrum `G12` of the two microphone pressures
is estimated with Welch-averaged, Hann-windowed segments
(`scipy.signal.csd`) and converted to the intensity spectral
density along the probe axis (definition 3.2 of IEC 61043:1994 gives
the underlying p-p formulation):

```text
I(f) = -Im{G12(f)} / (2 * pi * f * rho * spacing)
```

Positive intensity flows from microphone 1 towards microphone 2.
The mean-square pressure is taken from the mean signal
`(p1 + p2)/2` at the probe reference point. When `fraction` is
given, both quantities are integrated into octave (1) or one-third
octave (3) bands using the ANSI S1.11/IEC 61260-1 band edges of
[`phonometry.nominal_frequencies`](/phonometry/reference/api/filters/frequencies/#nominal_frequencies); bands without any spectral
bin are dropped. Broadband totals are always computed (over
`limits` when provided, otherwise over all positive frequencies).

The pressure-intensity index `Lp - LI` is reported per band and
broadband; in a free plane progressive wave it equals
`10*lg(rho*c/400)` = 0,14 dB (IEC 61043:1994 clause 5 note), while
large values flag reactive or noisy fields (compare with the
instrument dynamic capability, ISO 9614-1:1993 criterion 1).

Usable bandwidth: the finite-difference gradient biases the result
by the factor `sin(k*spacing)/(k*spacing)` (IEC 61043:1994, 7.3);
results are essentially unbiased (\< ~0,3 dB) below
`max_valid_frequency = 0,1 * c / spacing`, and `bias_correction`
provides the per-band compensation factor.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `p1` | Pressure signal of microphone 1, in pascals (1D). |
| `p2` | Pressure signal of microphone 2, in pascals (1D). |
| `fs` | Sample rate in Hz. |
| `spacing` | Microphone separation dr, in metres. |
| `rho` | Air density, in kg/m^3. Default 1,204 (20 degC). |
| `c` | Speed of sound, in m/s. Default 343,0. |
| `fraction` | `None` (broadband only), 1 (octave bands) or 3 (one-third octave bands). |
| `limits` | [f_min, f_max] band limits in Hz (default [12, 20000], as in [`phonometry.nominal_frequencies`](/phonometry/reference/api/filters/frequencies/#nominal_frequencies)). |
| `bias_correct` | If True, apply the per-bin finite-difference correction `(k*spacing)/sin(k*spacing)` (IEC 61043:1994, 7.3) to the intensity spectral density before summing the band and broadband totals, so the totals no longer under-read as the frequency approaches `max_valid_frequency`. The reciprocal diverges as `k*spacing -> pi` (the first spatial-aliasing null at `c/(2*spacing)`, inside the default band range for close spacings), so it is applied only over the probe's usable range — up to `k*spacing = pi/2` — and held constant beyond, keeping the totals bounded instead of letting a few near-null bins dominate them. Default False keeps the exact legacy totals; the per-band `bias_correction` factor (same clamped definition) is reported either way. |
