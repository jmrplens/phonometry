# Frequency Weighting (A, C, G, Z)

Frequency weighting curves simulate the human ear's sensitivity. A, C and Z
are specified by **IEC 61672-1:2013**; the infrasound G curve is specified by
**ISO 7196:1995**.

* **A-Weighting (`A`):** Standard for environmental noise (IEC 61672-1).
* **C-Weighting (`C`):** Used for peak sound pressure and high-level noise.
* **Z-Weighting (`Z`):** Zero weighting, completely flat response.
* **G-Weighting (`G`):** Infrasound weighting per ISO 7196 (see below).

## 1. Where the curves come from

The A and C curves are inverted equal-loudness contours, frozen into filters:
**A** approximates the inverse of the historic 40-phon contour (quiet levels,
where the ear discards bass most aggressively) and **C** the flatter ~100-phon
one (loud levels). IEC 61672-1:2013 (Annex E) defines both analytically from
four corner frequencies:

$$
f_1 = 20.599\ \text{Hz}, \quad f_2 = 107.653\ \text{Hz}, \quad
f_3 = 737.862\ \text{Hz}, \quad f_4 = 12194.217\ \text{Hz}
$$

C is a band-pass with double poles at $f_1$ and $f_4$ (2 zeros at the origin);
A adds the $f_2$ and $f_3$ poles (4 zeros), which is why it keeps falling
through the low-mids. Both are normalized to exactly 0 dB at 1 kHz. Z is the
absence of weighting. The full pole/zero derivation is in the
[Theory](theory-signal-analysis.md) page.

### A short history: A, B, C and Z

The chain runs from Fletcher and Munson's 1933 equal-loudness measurements
to the first American sound level meter standard (1936), which gave meters
switchable responses so the reading could approximate loudness at different
levels: **A** from the 40-phon contour for quiet sounds, **B** from the
~70-phon contour for moderate ones, and a flat response for loud ones (the
**C** curve proper, mirroring the flatter ~100-phon contour, arrived with
the 1944 revision). Switching curves by level died in practice (readings jumped at the
switch points, and field measurements became incomparable), but A survived
alone: decades of hearing-damage and community-annoyance data had been
collected with it, and it correlates with both about as well as far more
elaborate metrics. IEC 61672-1 (first edition 2002) finished the cleanup:
B was dropped, A and C were kept with tightened tolerances, and **Z** was
introduced to replace the vaguely specified "linear" of older meters, which
varied by manufacturer.

### When C − A matters

Because A discards bass and C keeps it, the difference
$L_{Ceq} - L_{Aeq}$ is a one-number indicator of low-frequency content:

- **Below about 10 dB**: an ordinary broadband spectrum; the A-weighted
  level rates it fairly.
- **Around 15 to 20 dB or more**: the energy is concentrated at low
  frequencies (HVAC rumble, compressors, music bass through a wall). The
  A-weighted level then understates the problem; look at the octave
  spectrum, and below 20 Hz switch to the G curve.
- **Hearing-protector selection**: the HML method of ISO 4869-2 keys on
  exactly this C-minus-A difference to decide how much low-frequency
  attenuation a protector must provide (the simpler SNR method sidesteps it
  by working from the C-weighted level directly).

```python
import numpy as np
from phonometry import metrology

# A 50 Hz rumble under a light broadband hiss: quiet in A, loud in C.
fs = 48000
t = np.arange(10 * fs) / fs
rng = np.random.default_rng(1)
x = 0.2 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * 50 * t) + 0.01 * rng.standard_normal(t.size)

la = metrology.leq(metrology.weighting_filter(x, fs, curve="A"))
lc = metrology.leq(metrology.weighting_filter(x, fs, curve="C"))
print(f"LAeq = {la:.1f} dB   LCeq = {lc:.1f} dB   C - A = {lc - la:.1f} dB")
# LAeq = 52.4 dB   LCeq = 75.7 dB   C - A = 23.2 dB
# C - A above 20 dB: the A-weighted number alone would hide the rumble.
```

## 2. Basic usage

```python
import numpy as np
from phonometry import metrology

# recording: a calibrated microphone capture (Pa) — recorded through your measurement chain. Synthesized here so the guide runs standalone.
fs = 48000
recording = 0.2 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * 1000 * np.arange(fs) / fs)

# Apply A-weighting to the raw recording
weighted_signal = metrology.weighting_filter(recording, fs, curve='A')

# Apply C-weighting for peak analysis
c_weighted_signal = metrology.weighting_filter(recording, fs, curve='C')
```

## 3. Infrasound: G-weighting (ISO 7196)

The **G frequency weighting** (ISO 7196:1995) rates infrasound the way A-weighting
rates audible noise. It is defined by a pole-zero configuration with 0 dB gain at
10 Hz, rises at 12 dB/octave from 1 Hz to 20 Hz (matching the steep growth of
perception in that band) and falls off at 24 dB/octave outside it. Use it for
sources with significant energy below 20 Hz (wind turbines, HVAC, blasting):

```python
import numpy as np
from phonometry import metrology

# recording: a calibrated microphone capture (Pa) — recorded through your measurement chain. Synthesized here so the guide runs standalone.
fs = 48000
recording = 0.2 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * 1000 * np.arange(fs) / fs)

g_weighted = metrology.weighting_filter(recording, fs, curve='G')
```

# Measure the G response: weight a centered unit impulse and take its

fs = 4000
impulse = np.zeros(20 * fs)
impulse[impulse.size // 2] = 1.0
freqs = np.fft.rfftfreq(impulse.size, 1 / fs)

The implementation follows the ISO 7196 Table 1 pole/zero values exactly and is
verified in CI against every Table 2 nominal response value (0.25 Hz to 315 Hz).
`WeightingFilter(fs, "G")` supports the same multichannel and stateful block
processing as A/C. Levels measured with the G curve are reported as
L<sub>pG</sub> (or L<sub>Geq</sub> for the equivalent level over time).

## 4. `weighting_filter()` / `WeightingFilter` parameters

| Parameter | Type | Units | Range / default | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `x` | 1D or 2D array | any | non-empty | 2D is `[channels, samples]` |
| `fs` | int | Hz | > 0 | |
| `curve` | str | — | `'A'` (default), `'C'`, `'G'`, `'Z'` | `'G'` per ISO 7196 (infrasound); `'Z'` is a bypass |
| `high_accuracy` | bool | — | default `True` (function); class default `None` resolves to `not stateful` | Internal oversampling keeps A/C in class 1 up to 16 kHz; details in §6 |
| `stateful` | bool (class only) | — | default `False` | Carries filter state across blocks (streaming) |
| `steady_ic` | bool (class only) | — | default `False` | Steady-state initial conditions (no onset transient) |

## 5. Reusable filter object

If you weight many signals with the same parameters, design the filter once:

```python
import numpy as np
from phonometry import metrology

# recording: a calibrated microphone capture (Pa) — recorded through your measurement chain. Synthesized here so the guide runs standalone.
fs = 48000
recording = 0.2 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * 1000 * np.arange(fs) / fs)

wf = metrology.WeightingFilter(fs, "A")
signals = [recording]                # your batch of recordings
for recording in signals:
    weighted = wf.filter(recording)
```

## 6. High-frequency accuracy (`high_accuracy`)

A plain bilinear-transform design compresses the response near Nyquist: at
fs = 48 kHz the A-curve error at 12.5 kHz reaches −2.7 dB, outside the IEC
61672-1 **class 1** tolerance (+2.0/−2.5 dB).

By default (`high_accuracy=True`), phonometry designs and runs the weighting
filter at an internally oversampled rate (up to 8×, reaching ≥ 144 kHz at
common audio rates; a 96 kHz input runs ×2) and decimates back, keeping
the response within class 1 tolerances up to 16 kHz (error ≈ −0.5 dB at
12.5 kHz for fs = 48 kHz).

*The plain bilinear design (red) crosses the class 1 tolerance near 12.5 kHz;

    response = 20 * np.log10(np.abs(np.fft.rfft(weighted))

- `high_accuracy=False` restores the legacy plain-bilinear behavior.
- For `'G'` the flag is silently ignored: its 0.25–315 Hz range is already
  exact with the plain design.
- **Stateful (block) processing** always uses the legacy design: the internal
  FIR resampling is incompatible with block continuity. Passing
  `high_accuracy=True` together with `stateful=True` raises a `ValueError`.

```python
import numpy as np
from phonometry import metrology

# recording: a calibrated microphone capture (Pa) — recorded through your measurement chain. Synthesized here so the guide runs standalone.
fs = 48000
recording = 0.2 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * 1000 * np.arange(fs) / fs)

# Explicit legacy behavior
y = metrology.weighting_filter(recording, fs, curve="A", high_accuracy=False)

# Stateful block processing (legacy design, state carried between blocks)
wf = metrology.WeightingFilter(fs, "A", stateful=True)
blocks = [recording]                 # your sequence of recording blocks
for block in blocks:
    weighted = wf.filter(block)
```

See [Block Processing](block-processing.md) for the streaming workflow and
[Theory](theory-signal-analysis.md) for the analytic curve definitions.

## 7. Verifying the IEC 61672-1 class

`verify_weighting_class` checks a weighting filter against the acceptance
limits of **IEC 61672-1:2013** (Table 3). It evaluates the filter's relative
response at the *exact* base-10 frequency behind each nominal label below
Nyquist (Table 3's design goals are computed at $f = 1000 \cdot 10^{n/10}$,
e.g. 15 848.9 Hz for "16 kHz"; IEC 61672-3 tests at the same frequencies),
subtracts the design-goal weighting, and reports the performance class per
frequency with its margin in dB. A dense logarithmic sweep additionally
enforces subclause 5.5.7 *between* the nominal frequencies (the deviation
from the analytic Annex E goal must stay within the larger of the two
adjacent limits, so a resonance or notch between nominals cannot pass), and
when Table 3 rows with finite lower limits fall beyond Nyquist the verdict is
flagged `range_limited` (it then attests the checked frequencies only, not
full 10 Hz-20 kHz conformance):

```python
from phonometry import metrology

result = metrology.verify_weighting_class(metrology.WeightingFilter(48000, "A"))
print(result["overall_class"])          # 1
print(result["range_limited"])          # False
print(result["between_nominals"])       # {'worst_freq': ..., 'margin_class1_db': ...}
print(result["bands"][20])
# {'freq': 1000.0, 'class': 1, 'deviation_db': 0.0, 'margin_class1_db': 0.7, 'margin_class2_db': 1.0}
```

The Table 3 acceptance mask itself is public too: `weighting_class_limits(1)`
returns the 34 nominal frequencies with the lower/upper deviation limits (a
lower limit of `-inf` means only the upper limit applies). The limits qualify
the *deviation* from the design goal, so they are the same for A, C and Z.

*The oversampled A and C designs (blue, purple) stay near zero deviation,
well inside the class 1 corridor (shaded); the wider class 2 limits are
dotted. The corridor widens at the band extremes where only a one-sided
limit applies.*
