r"""Psophometric quasi-peak programme-level meter (ITU-R BS.468-4 clause 2).

ITU-R BS.468-4 specifies the instrument that measures audio-frequency noise
voltage in sound broadcasting as two parts. Clause 1 is the weighting
network, realised elsewhere in this library
(:func:`phonometry.filters.weighting_filter` with ``curve="468"``, from the
Fig. 1a ladder). Clause 2 is the detector this module implements: a
**quasi-peak** value method, whose reading is reported in **dBqps**
(clause 3).

**Clause 2 prints no dynamics.** It gives no time constant, no rise time, no
decay law, no transfer function and no differential equation. The words
"time constant" occur once in the whole Recommendation, in an informative
Note that offers "two peak rectifier circuits of different time-constants
connected in tandem" as *a possible arrangement* after full-wave
rectification, and the preamble says the performance "may be realized in a
variety of ways". What clause 2 does give is eleven acceptance windows:
Table 2 reads a single 5 kHz tone burst at eight durations from 1 ms to
200 ms, Table 3 reads a train of 5 ms bursts at 2, 10 and 100 per second,
and each cell carries a reference reading with a lower and an upper limit,
expressed as a percentage of the reading the same tone gives steadily. Those
eleven windows are the entire specification of the dynamics, and they are
what :func:`verify_quasi_peak_dynamics` checks.

The one absolute statement clause 2 does make is clause 2.6: a steady 1 kHz
sine at 0.775 V r.m.s. shall read 0.775 V, that is 0 dBqps. So the detector
reads the **r.m.s.** of a steady sine, not its peak, and that fixes the scale
of the whole instrument (NOTE 2 to clause 1: "The whole instrument is
calibrated at 1 kHz"). Here that scale is not a stored number but a
measurement: :func:`quasi_peak_meter` runs its own chain on a 1 kHz sine of
1 V r.m.s. at the caller's sample rate and divides by what it reads, so
clause 2.6 holds exactly at every rate rather than at the one rate a frozen
constant would have been fitted at.

What this module chooses, because the Recommendation does not
--------------------------------------------------------------

Six decisions, none of them in BS.468-4, all of them inseparable: change any
one and :data:`BS468_BALLISTICS` has to be refitted.

* **Full-wave rectification** as :math:`|x|`, following the Note's own
  wording. An analytic-signal envelope also meets all eleven windows when it
  is refitted from scratch, with a three times larger worst-case residual.
* **A peak rectifier** as a one-pole recursion with different rise and fall
  rates, the same asymmetric kernel the impulse time weighting uses
  (:func:`phonometry.filters.weighting.time_weighting`), discharging toward
  the input rather than toward zero. Refitting toward zero instead moves the
  worst residual by 0.002 dB, so the discharge law is not load-bearing.
* **One symmetric reading device** after it, first order. Clause 2.5 treats
  "the reading device" as a separate object, and a peak rectifier alone
  cannot meet the tables: its best fit is 4.3 dB out at the worst point and
  leaves only 4 of the 11 readings inside their windows.
* **The reading is the maximum of the reading device's output over the
  record**, which is what an operator writes down from a pointer. The record
  therefore has to include the decay: a burst that ends at the last sample
  is read before the needle has finished rising.
* **The reference for Tables 2 and 3** is the same chain fed a steady 5 kHz
  tone through the same network, so both tables are ratios and every
  absolute factor, the network's +11.7 dB at 5 kHz included, cancels.
* **The ballistics run at the caller's rate** on the record
  :func:`phonometry.filters.weighting_filter` returns. Measured across 32,
  44.1, 48, 96 and 192 kHz, no reading moves by more than 0.080 dB, or 4.2 %
  of its own window.

What no oracle can check
------------------------

The tables use one carrier, one waveform, one amplitude, eight durations and
three repetition rates, and that is the whole specification. There is no
reference implementation, no tabulated impulse response and no worked
example in BS.468-4, in IEC 60268-1:1985 Appendix A or in either 1988
amendment. So the **response to noise**, which is the instrument's entire
purpose, is unverifiable: two conforming detectors will disagree on noise,
on speech and on programme material by an amount nothing in the document
bounds. So is the relationship between a dB(468) quasi-peak figure and a
dB(A) r.m.s. one, and so is everything outside the tabulated stimuli
(bursts shorter than 0.6 ms or longer than 200 ms, carriers other than
5 kHz, anything that is not a gated sine).

Four clauses are computable and pass **by construction** rather than by
measurement, because rectification, first-order recursions and a maximum are
all positively homogeneous and cannot overshoot a monotone step: clause 2.1's
two attenuator variants, clause 2.3's +-1 dB over 20 dB of 0.6 ms bursts,
clause 2.4's 0.5 dB reversibility (:math:`|-x| = |x|`, so the difference is
exactly zero) and clause 2.5's 0.3 dB overswing cap. They are properties of
the arithmetic, not evidence about the design. The rest of clauses 2.3, 2.6
and 2.7 has nothing to compute at all: overload capacity above full scale,
the law of a logarithmic stage, a calibrated scale range of at least 20 dB,
an input impedance of at least 20 kOhm and a 600 Ohm termination are
instrument hardware, and "80 % of full scale" constrains where a real needle
sits during the test rather than the quantity, which is why this module does
not model a full scale at all.

**There is no** :meth:`~QuasiPeakResult.report` **fiche.** BS.468-4
prescribes no report format, no declaration form and no worked example; the
conformity evidence is the eleven windows, and its home is
``docs/CONFORMANCE.md`` through :func:`verify_quasi_peak_dynamics`.

#: 1.02 to 1.90 ms of charge (a factor of 1.88), 230 to 370 ms of discharge
#: (1.61) and 96 to 200 ms of reading device (2.09). Each of those six edges

    reading rule is the maximum over the record, so the record must include
    the decay of whatever it is measuring: a burst that ends at the last
    sample is read before the needle has finished rising.

    The chain and everything it chooses that the Recommendation does not are
    described in the module docstring; the time constants are
    :data:`BS468_BALLISTICS`, a fit to Tables 2 and 3 rather than a quoted
    value, and :func:`verify_quasi_peak_dynamics` is what checks them.

    **Units.** The detector itself is unit-agnostic: rectification,
    first-order recursions and a maximum carry whatever unit the record
    arrived in, and the eleven acceptance windows are ratios in which every
    unit cancels. Only the *level* needs a unit, and clause 2.6 gives
    BS.468-4 exactly one, the volt. A bare array or an uncalibrated
    :class:`~phonometry.io.Signal` is therefore read against 0.775 V and its
    ``level_db`` is dBqps. A **calibrated** Signal is analysed in pascals,
    as everywhere else in this library, and then has to be given a
    *reference* of its own: 0.775 V is not a pressure, and BS.468-4 offers
    no pressure to put in its place. ``result.level_unit`` names whichever
    scale came out.

    :param x: The record: a 1-D array, or a :class:`phonometry.io.Signal`.
