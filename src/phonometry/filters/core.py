    This method uses a filter bank with Second-Order Sections (SOS) coefficients.
    To obtain the correct coefficients, automatic subsampling is applied to the
    signal in each filtered band.

    Multichannel support: If x is 2D (channels, samples), each channel is filtered.

    :param x: Input signal (1D array or 2D array [channels, samples]), or a
        :class:`phonometry.io.Signal` read from a measurement file.
    :type x: Union[List[float], np.ndarray, phonometry.io.Signal]
    :param fs: Sample rate in Hz. Required for a bare array; a
        :class:`~phonometry.io.Signal` brings its own, and an explicit value
        that disagrees with it raises instead of silently winning.
    :type fs: Optional[int]
    :param fraction: Bandwidth 'b'. Examples: 1/3-octave b=3, 1-octave b=1, 2/3-octave b=1.5. Default: 1.
    :type fraction: float
    :param order: Order of the filter. Default: 6.
    :type order: int
    :param limits: Minimum and maximum limit frequencies [f_min, f_max]. Default [12, 20000].
    :type limits: Optional[List[float]]
    :param sigbands: If True, also return the signal in the time domain divided into bands.
    :type sigbands: bool
    :param detrend: If True, remove DC offset before filtering. Default: True.
    :type detrend: bool
    :param mode: 'rms' or 'peak'. Default: 'rms'.
    :param nominal: If True, return IEC 61260-1 nominal frequency labels (List[str]) instead of exact floats.
    :param design: How the band filters are designed: family, ripple, stopband
        attenuation and multirate decimation (:class:`FilterDesign`). The
        default 'butter' family is the only one that meets IEC 61260-1 class 1
        with the default parameters; for ``cheby2`` scipy pins the
        deep-stopband floor at exactly ``attenuation``, so it must be >= 70 dB
        to clear the class 1 limit (matches :class:`OctaveFilterBank`).
    :param calibration: How band energy becomes a level: calibration factor
        and dBFS switch (:class:`LevelCalibration`). This is the explicit
        knob: when its ``factor`` is left at 1.0, a calibrated
        :class:`~phonometry.io.Signal` supplies its own and the band levels
        come out in dB SPL; when it carries a factor, the object's is not
        applied on top (that would square it). ``dbfs=True`` ignores both
        the object and the factor, being referenced to digital full scale.
    :param response_plot: Whether to show or save the filter response plot
        (:class:`ResponsePlot`). Plotting bypasses the design cache.
    :return: A tuple containing (SPL_array, Frequencies_list) or (SPL_array, Frequencies_list, signals).
