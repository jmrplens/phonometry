title: "Dynamic stiffness of resilient materials (EN 29052-1)"
description: "The EN 29052-1:1992 determination of the dynamic stiffness per unit area of resilient materials under floating floors from the load-plate resonance: the apparent stiffness of Formula 4, the enclosed-gas term of Formula 7, the airflow-resistivity regimes of clause 8.2, and the floating-floor natural frequency of Formula 2."

A **floating floor** is a heavy floating slab resting on a resilient layer; the
two form a mass-spring system whose **natural frequency** governs how much the
floor improves impact and airborne insulation. **EN 29052-1:1992** (identical to
ISO 9052-1:1989) measures the **dynamic stiffness per unit area** `s'` of the
resilient layer from the resonance of a standard load plate on a
200 mm × 200 mm specimen. `s'` is the input to the floating-floor term of the
EN 12354-2 impact model covered in
[Predicting Sound Insulation (EN 12354)](/phonometry/guides/insulation-prediction/). (ISO 16251-1 does not apply
here: its scope is limited to soft, locally-reacting floor coverings and
explicitly excludes floating floors.)

## 1. Dynamic stiffness and resonance

The dynamic stiffness per unit area is a dynamic force per area divided by the
resulting change in thickness (Formula 1): `s' = (F/S)/Δd`. The resiliently
supported floor is a resonator whose natural frequency (Formula 2) and, in the
laboratory arrangement, measured resonant frequency (Formula 3) are

$$
f_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{s'}{m'}}, \qquad
f_r = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{s'_t}{m'_t}},
$$

so the **apparent** dynamic stiffness follows from the resonance (Formula 4):

$$
s'_t = 4\pi^2\,m'_t\,f_r^2 .
$$

In the test arrangement the specimen lies between the rigid foundation and a
load plate whose total mass per unit area, plate plus added load, is
200 kg/m² (8 kg on the 0.04 m² specimen). That load reproduces the static
preload of a typical floating floor, about 2 kPa. A vertical exciter drives
the plate, an accelerometer picks up its response, and the fundamental
vertical resonance $f_r$ of the plate-on-specimen system is read from the
response peak; Formula 4 turns it into $s'_t$.

```python
from phonometry import materials

# Standard 8 kg load plate on the 0.04 m2 specimen -> m't = 200 kg/m2;
# the fundamental resonance is measured at 25 Hz.
s_t = materials.apparent_dynamic_stiffness(resonant_frequency=25.0, total_mass_per_area=200.0)
print(round(s_t / 1e6, 3))                              # 4.935  MN/m3

# Installed on a 120 kg/m2 floating screed with s' = 10 MN/m3:
print(round(materials.natural_frequency(10e6, 120.0), 1))      # 45.9  Hz
```

## 2. The enclosed-gas term and airflow resistivity

For an air-permeable material the enclosed pore air adds a parallel stiffness
from its isothermal compression (Formula 7): `s'a = p₀/(d·ε)`, with `p₀` the
atmospheric pressure, `d` the loaded thickness and `ε` the porosity. The
standard's worked NOTE (`p₀ = 0.1 MPa`, `ε = 0.9`) is `s'a = 111/d` MN/m³ for
`d` in millimetres:

```python
from phonometry import materials

print(round(materials.enclosed_gas_stiffness(thickness=0.020, porosity=0.9) / 1e6, 2))
# 5.56  MN/m3   (the NOTE's 111/20 = 5.55 MN/m3)
```

The dynamic stiffness of the *installed* material is then set by the lateral
airflow resistivity `r` (clause 8.2): `s' = s't` for `r ≥ 100 kPa·s/m²`,
`s' = s't + s'a` for `10 ≤ r < 100 kPa·s/m²`, and for `r < 10 kPa·s/m²` the
method only resolves `s' = s't` when the gas term is negligible.
`floating_floor_resonance` chains the whole determination:

```python
from phonometry import materials

res = materials.floating_floor_resonance(
    resonant_frequency=25.0, total_mass_per_area=200.0,
    floor_mass_per_area=120.0,
    airflow_resistivity=50.0, thickness=0.020, porosity=0.9,
)
print(round(res.dynamic_stiffness / 1e6, 2), round(res.natural_frequency, 1))
# 10.49 47.1
```

The `DynamicStiffnessResult` carries the apparent, enclosed-gas and installed
stiffnesses, the test resonance and the installed-floor natural frequency, and
its `.plot()` draws the `f₀(s')` design curve.

## 3. What the resonance method assumes, and where it bites

The evaluation treats the rig as a single-degree-of-freedom system: the load
plate moves as a rigid piston on a massless spring. That holds while the
specimen is light against the plate and its first internal resonance sits
well above $f_r$; a heavy or very thick layer starts to act as a distributed
system and the simple Formula 4 reading degrades. Three practical pitfalls
follow from the preload:

* **`s'` is a stiffness *at the standard preload*.** Resilient layers are
  visibly non-linear in static load: mineral wool stiffens as it compresses,
  some foams soften. The 200 kg/m² load plate fixes the operating point, so
  the tabulated `s'` strictly describes floors near that surface mass.
  Designing a much heavier screed with the same `s'` extrapolates beyond the
  measurement.
* **Drive small.** The tangent stiffness is defined for small dynamic
  strains; driving the plate hard pushes the layer into its non-linear range
  and shifts the apparent resonance downward. Keep the excitation at the
  lowest level that gives a clean peak.
* **Respect the contact.** The standard seats the load plate on a thin
  bonding layer (a plaster paste) so the full specimen area carries the
  load. A dry, uneven contact concentrates the force, stiffens the response
  locally and biases $f_r$ upward.

The natural frequency that matters in the end is not the rig's $f_r$ but the
installed floor's $f_0$ from Formula 2: the floating floor only improves
insulation well above $f_0$, which is why a low `s'` (a soft layer under a
heavy slab) is the design goal.
