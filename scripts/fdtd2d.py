"""Compatibility shim for the documentation figure/animation generators.

The 2D acoustic FDTD engine that used to live here was promoted to the
public library as :mod:`phonometry.simulation.fdtd`; this module re-exports
it so the committed animation scripts keep importing ``fdtd2d`` unchanged.
The physics (grid setup, leapfrog stepping, sources, sponge layers) is the
library code itself, so the committed clips only change when the library
changes.
