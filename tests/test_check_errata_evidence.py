"""The errata evidence gate, exercised on the entry that made it necessary.

``scripts/check_errata_evidence.py`` exists because an entry was drafted that
accused an author of printing ``2/(3 pi)`` where the page prints
``2/(sqrt(3) pi)``: three text extractors had eaten the radical and agreed with
each other. It cited no page and stated its own ratio twice, as "1,73 times
too small" and as "a fixed 2,4 dB offset". Both tells are reproduced below,
together with the shapes a passing entry has to have.
