title: "Sound power from surface vibration (ISO/TS 7849)"
description: "The ISO/TS 7849 estimation of airborne sound power from a machine's surface vibration: the radiated power P = Z_c⟨v²⟩Sε, the velocity level and its calibration, the surface mean, the radiation factor ε, and the sound power level L_W = L_v + 10 lg(S/S0) + 10 lg(ε) + 10 lg(411/400) — Part 1 upper limit (ε=1) and Part 2 engineering value."

The airborne sound power a machine radiates through the structure-borne
vibration of its outer surface can be estimated from the surface vibratory
velocity and a **radiation factor** `ε` (the radiation efficiency), without an
acoustic measurement. The radiated power is (ISO/TS 7849-1, Formula 6)

$$
P = Z_c \, \langle v^2 \rangle \, S \, \varepsilon \quad [\mathrm{W}],
$$

with `Z_c` the characteristic impedance of air, `⟨v²⟩` the mean-square vibratory
velocity over the radiating area `S`. Expressed in levels (velocity level re
`v₀ = 5·10⁻⁸ m/s`), the A-weighted sound power level is (Formula 12 / 15)

$$
L_W = L_v + 10\lg\frac{S}{S_0} + 10\lg\varepsilon
      + 10\lg\frac{Z_{c,n}}{Z_{c,0}},
$$

where `S₀ = 1 m²`, the normalized impedance `Z_{c,n} = 411 N·s/m³` and the
reference `Z_{c,0} = 400 N·s/m³` give the fixed `10 lg(411/400) = 0.118 dB`
term. This module feeds the structure-borne source and building prediction
standards (ISO 9611, EN 15657, EN 12354-5).

## 1. The two parts

The two parts differ only in the radiation factor. **Part 1 (survey)** assumes
`ε = 1` and yields the *upper limit* `L_W,max`, needing only the velocity level
and the area. **Part 2 (engineering)** applies a frequency-band radiation factor
`εⱼ` determined (per ISO 9614) as `εⱼ = Pⱼ/(Z_{c,n}·⟨vⱼ²⟩·S)`.

```python
import numpy as np
import phonometry as ph

bands = np.array([250.0, 500.0, 1000.0, 2000.0])
lv = np.array([82.0, 85.0, 83.0, 79.0])          # mean velocity level per band [dB]

# Part 1 upper limit (epsilon = 1):
upper = ph.sound_power_from_vibration(lv, area=1.6, frequencies=bands)
print(round(upper.total_level, 1))               # e.g. 89.4  dB re 1 pW

# Part 2 engineering value with a measured radiation factor:
eps = np.array([0.45, 0.75, 0.95, 1.00])
eng = ph.sound_power_from_vibration(lv, area=1.6, radiation_factor=eps, frequencies=bands)
print(np.round(eng.sound_power_level, 1))        # per-band L_W
```

## 2. Velocity level, calibration and the radiation factor

The velocity level is `L_v = 20·lg(v/v₀)` (Formula 3); a sinusoidal calibration
acceleration converts as `L_v = 20·lg(â/(2πf·v₀·√2))` (Formula 8). The radiation
factor comes from an independently measured power:

```python
import phonometry as ph

# The standard's worked calibration EXAMPLE: 9.81 m/s^2 at 100 Hz.
print(round(float(ph.velocity_level_from_acceleration(9.81, 100.0)), 1))   # 106.9 dB

# Radiation factor from a measured power (ISO 9614): eps = P / (Zc <v^2> S).
eps = ph.radiation_factor(3.0e-4, area=2.0, mean_square_velocity=(1e-3)**2)
print(round(float(eps), 3))                                                # 0.365
```

Surface velocity levels from several positions are combined with the energetic
mean `mean_velocity_level` (Formula 10) or its area-weighted form (Formula 11),
and the correction `extraneous_velocity_correction` removes extraneous
vibration per Table 2.

## 3. When the radiation-factor assumption breaks

The whole method stands on one substitution: replacing the acoustic
measurement by `ε`. The Part 1 value `ε = 1` is close to the true radiation
factor only above the **critical (coincidence) frequency** of plate-like
parts, where bending waves travel faster than sound and the surface radiates
like a piston. Below coincidence, adjacent zones of the
plate move in antiphase and their radiation largely cancels: `ε` drops far
below one and falls quickly with decreasing frequency, so the survey method
can overstate the low-frequency bands of a large thin casing by 10 dB and
more. The same cancellation makes small sources radiate poorly (the acoustic
short circuit around an unbaffled panel). Two further assumptions are easy
to violate in the field:

* **The measured vibration must be the machine's own.** Vibration fed in
  from neighbouring machinery inflates `⟨v²⟩`; Table 2 prescribes the
  source-off check and `extraneous_velocity_correction` applies it.
* **The surface must be the dominant radiator.** Airborne sound from
  openings, intakes or internal sources that bypasses the measured casing is
  invisible to a velocity survey; the method characterises the
  structure-borne part only.

Part 2 exists exactly for the radiation-factor problem: it replaces the
fixed `ε = 1`
with a band-by-band `εⱼ` determined from one reference measurement of the
radiated power (ISO 9614 intensity), after which the velocity survey can be
repeated cheaply on nominally identical machines.
