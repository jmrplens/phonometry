Spherical-wave ground effect and advanced barrier diffraction.

This module extends the tabulated ground and barrier terms of ISO 9613-2 (see
[`phonometry.environment.propagation.outdoor_propagation`](/phonometry/reference/api/environment/outdoor-propagation/)) with the underlying wave
acoustics: the spherical-wave reflection coefficient of a finite-impedance
ground and the wave-theoretic diffraction of a screen, both in a homogeneous
(non-refracting, non-turbulent) atmosphere.

Ground effect (Weyl-Van der Pol)
--------------------------------
The sound field of a point source above a locally reacting ground is the sum of
a direct wave and a reflected wave weighted by the spherical-wave reflection
coefficient `Q` (Attenborough & Van Renterghem, *Predicting Outdoor Sound*
2e, 2021, Eq. (2.40a); Salomons, *Computational Atmospheric Acoustics*, 2001,
Eq. (3.2)):

$$
p = \frac{e^{ikR_1}}{4 \pi R_1} + Q \, \frac{e^{ikR_2}}{4 \pi R_2}
$$

with $R_1$ the source-receiver distance, $R_2$ the image-source
distance and (Attenborough Eq. (2.40c) / Salomons Eq. (D.58)):

$$
Q = R_\mathrm{p} + (1 - R_\mathrm{p}) F(w)
$$

$$
R_\mathrm{p} = \frac{Z \cos\theta - 1}{Z \cos\theta + 1} \tag{Salomons Eq. D.59}
$$

$$
F(w) = 1 + i \sqrt{\pi} \, w \exp(-w^2) \operatorname{erfc}(-i w) \tag{Salomons Eq. D.60}
$$

$$
w = \sqrt{i k R_2 / 2} \, \left( \cos\theta + \frac{1}{Z} \right) \tag{Salomons Eq. D.57}
$$

Here `Z` is the normalized (by `rho c`) surface impedance of the ground,
`theta` is the angle of incidence from the ground normal
($\cos\theta = (h_\mathrm{s} + h_\mathrm{r})/R_2$) and $F(w)$ is the boundary-loss
factor written through the scaled complementary error function
$\exp(-w^2) \operatorname{erfc}(-i w)$, i.e.
the Faddeeva function `scipy.special.wofz`. The relative sound level (the
"excess attenuation", dB re free field) is:

$$
\Delta L = 20 \log_{10} \left| 1 + Q \, \frac{R_1}{R_2} \, e^{i k (R_2 - R_1)} \right| \tag{Salomons Eq. 3.4}
$$

Limits reproduced by the implementation: an acoustically hard ground
($|Z| \to \infty$) gives $R_\mathrm{p} \to 1$, so
$(1 - R_\mathrm{p}) \to 0$ and $Q \to 1$
regardless of the boundary loss (the ground wave vanishes), and
$\Delta L$ reaches
`+6 dB` in phase (Salomons Sec. 3.4); at grazing incidence
($h_\mathrm{s}, h_\mathrm{r} \to 0$, $\cos\theta \to 0$) $R_\mathrm{p} \to -1$; and as
the range grows ($R_2 \to \infty$) $|w| \to \infty$ and
$F \to 0$. The ground impedance is taken in
the $e^{-i \omega t}$ time convention of Salomons, in which a passive
ground has $\operatorname{Im}(Z) > 0$; it may be supplied directly or
derived from the porous models of `phonometry.materials`
([`delany_bazley`](/phonometry/reference/api/materials/porous/#delany_bazley) / [`miki`](/phonometry/reference/api/materials/porous/#miki)),
which model a semi-infinite porous ground whose surface impedance equals the
characteristic impedance of the medium. The materials domain works in the
opposite $e^{+j \omega t}$ convention ($\operatorname{Im}(Z) < 0$
for a passive medium), so
any impedance obtained from a porous model is conjugated internally before it
enters the formulas above.

Barrier diffraction
-------------------
Three levels of screening beyond the ISO 9613-2 `Dz` term are provided:

* the Kurze-Anderson closed form in the Fresnel number `N` (Bies, Hansen &
  Howard, *Engineering Noise Control* 5e, 2017, Eq. (5.138); Kurze & Anderson,
  1971),
  $\Delta = 5 + 20 \log_{10}\!\left[ \sqrt{2 \pi N} / \tanh\sqrt{2 \pi N} \right]$,
  which tends to `5 dB` at $N \to 0$ and stays within about 1.5 dB of
  Maekawa's point-source curve for all `N` (a very good fit for
  $N > 0.5$);

* the wave-theoretic insertion loss of a rigid thin screen (half-plane), the
  flat-wedge limit of the MacDonald / Hadden & Pierce solution
  (Attenborough Eqs. (9.19)-(9.20)), obtained from the auxiliary Fresnel
  functions and correctly giving `6 dB` at the shadow boundary (the field is
  halved);

* the coherent barrier-on-ground model that combines the four source-image /
  receiver-image diffracted paths with the spherical-wave reflection
  coefficient `Q` above (Attenborough Ch. 9; Bies Sec. 5.3.5), which shows the
  ground-barrier interference structure a purely energetic sum cannot.

Thick barriers (or two parallel thin screens) are handled by the double-edge
Fresnel number $N = (2/\lambda)(A + B + e - d)$ (Bies Eq. (5.157)).

## barrier_insertion_loss

```python
barrier_insertion_loss(
    frequencies: ArrayLike,
    source_height: float,
    barrier_distance: float,
    barrier_height: float,
    receiver_distance: float,
    receiver_height: float,
    *,
    method: Literal['kurze_anderson', 'exact'] = 'exact',
    thickness: float | None = None,
    ground_impedance: ArrayLike | PorousMediumResult | None = None,
    ground_flow_resistivity: float | None = None,
    ground_model: Literal['delany_bazley', 'miki'] = 'delany_bazley',
    speed_of_sound: float = 343.0,
    air_density: float = 1.205,
) -> BarrierInsertionLoss
```

Insertion loss of a thin, thick or ground-coupled barrier.

The 2-D geometry places the source at `(0, source_height)`, the (near)
diffraction edge at `(barrier_distance, barrier_height)` and the receiver
at `(receiver_distance, receiver_height)`. Three models are available:

* `method="kurze_anderson"`: the closed form
  [`kurze_anderson_attenuation`](/phonometry/reference/api/environment/ground-barriers/#kurze_anderson_attenuation) of the Fresnel number
  [`fresnel_number`](/phonometry/reference/api/environment/ground-barriers/#fresnel_number) (Bies Eqs. (5.134)/(5.138)); with `thickness` the
  double-edge Fresnel number $N = (2/\lambda)(A + B + e - d)$ of
  Bies Eq. (5.157) is used, `e` being the top width.
* `method="exact"` without ground: the wave-theoretic insertion loss of the
  rigid thin screen (`_screen_field`, MacDonald / Hadden & Pierce),
  $\mathrm{IL} = 20 \log_{10} |p_{\text{free}} / p_{\text{diffracted}}|$.
* `method="exact"` with a ground (`ground_impedance` or
  `ground_flow_resistivity`): the coherent four-path model. The field with
  the barrier sums the four source-image / receiver-image diffracted paths,
  each ground reflection weighted by the spherical-wave coefficient `Q`
  ([`spherical_reflection_coefficient`](/phonometry/reference/api/environment/ground-barriers/#spherical_reflection_coefficient)); the field without the barrier
  is the two-ray ground field. This exposes the ground-barrier interference
  structure (Attenborough Ch. 9; Bies Sec. 5.3.5). As a first-order
  simplification a single `Q` (evaluated over the overall
  source-receiver geometry) weights every bounce rather than a separate
  coefficient per image path; the model is coherent and reciprocal but not
  a full boundary-element solution.

`A` and `B` are the two segments of the shortest source-edge-receiver
path and `d` is the straight source-receiver distance. `N` is positive

## ground_effect

```python
ground_effect(
    frequencies: ArrayLike,
    source_height: float,
    receiver_height: float,
    distance: float,
    *,
    impedance: ArrayLike | PorousMediumResult,
    model: Literal['delany_bazley', 'miki'] = ...,
    speed_of_sound: float = ...,
    air_density: float = ...,
) -> SphericalGroundResult

ground_effect(
    frequencies: ArrayLike,
    source_height: float,
    receiver_height: float,
    distance: float,
    *,
    flow_resistivity: float,
    model: Literal['delany_bazley', 'miki'] = ...,
    speed_of_sound: float = ...,
    air_density: float = ...,
) -> SphericalGroundResult
```

Spherical-wave ground effect above a finite-impedance ground.

Assembles the two-ray field
$p = e^{ikR_1}/(4 \pi R_1) + Q \, e^{ikR_2}/(4 \pi R_2)$
with the spherical-wave reflection coefficient `Q` of
[`spherical_reflection_coefficient`](/phonometry/reference/api/environment/ground-barriers/#spherical_reflection_coefficient) and reports the relative sound
level
$\Delta L = 20 \log_{10}\left| 1 + Q (R_1/R_2) e^{i k (R_2 - R_1)} \right|$ (Salomons Eq. (3.4)),
i.e. the level re the free field.

The ground surface impedance is either supplied through `impedance` (a
normalized complex array/scalar, or a
[`PorousMediumResult`](/phonometry/reference/api/materials/porous/#porousmediumresult)) or derived from an
effective `flow_resistivity` (in Pa s/m2) via the `model` porous model
of the materials domain. Exactly one of the two must be given.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `frequencies` | Frequencies, in hertz. |
| `source_height` | Source height `hs`, in metres. |
| `receiver_height` | Receiver height `hr`, in metres. |
| `distance` | Horizontal source-receiver distance, in metres. |
| `impedance` | Normalized ground impedance ($e^{-i \omega t}$ convention, $\operatorname{Im}(Z) > 0$ for a passive ground), or a `PorousMediumResult` (which is conjugated internally from the materials' $e^{+j \omega t}$ convention). |
| `flow_resistivity` | Effective flow resistivity `sigma` (Pa s/m2); grassland is about `2e5` (Salomons Sec. 3.1). The porous model raises a [`PorousAbsorberWarning`](/phonometry/reference/api/materials/porous/#porousabsorberwarning) when the lowest bands fall below its published fit range $0.01 < \rho f / \sigma < 1$ (it still extrapolates a value there). |
| `model` | Porous model for `flow_resistivity` (`"delany_bazley"` or `"miki"`). |
| `speed_of_sound` | Speed of sound `c`, in m/s. |
| `air_density` | Air density `rho`, in kg/m3. |

**Returns:** A [`SphericalGroundResult`](/phonometry/reference/api/environment/ground-barriers/#sphericalgroundresult).

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | If neither or both of `impedance`/`flow_resistivity` are given, a height is negative, or the distance is not positive. |

## kurze_anderson_attenuation

```python
kurze_anderson_attenuation(fresnel_number: ArrayLike) -> Real
```

Kurze-Anderson barrier attenuation (Bies Eq. (5.138); Kurze & Anderson, 1971).

$$
\Delta = 5 + 20 \log_{10}\!\left[ \frac{\sqrt{2 \pi N}} {\tanh\sqrt{2 \pi N}} \right] \qquad \text{dB}
$$

For $N \to 0$ the ratio tends to 1 and $\Delta \to 5$ dB; for
$N < 0$
(bright zone) the square root is imaginary and `tanh` becomes `tan`, so
the expression continues smoothly until, below $N = -0.2$ (the
illuminated-zone limit of Maekawa's curve), the diffraction is taken as
negligible (0 dB) rather than let the closed form oscillate through the
tangent poles. It stays within about 1.5 dB of Maekawa's point-source curve
for all `N` (a very good fit for $N > 0.5$). The result is clamped
at 0 dB (a barrier never amplifies).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `fresnel_number` | Fresnel number `N` (scalar or array). |

**Returns:** Attenuation `Delta`, in decibels (>= 0), matching the input shape.

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | for a non-numeric or non-finite `fresnel_number`. |

```
