Calibrated time-frequency analysis: STFT spectrogram and zoom FFT.

Fine-band time-frequency views of a record, following Bendat & Piersol,
*Random Data: Analysis and Measurement Procedures* (4th ed., 2010):

* the **spectrogram** (Section 12.6.4.2): short-time Fourier transforms of
  contiguous, tapered, possibly overlapped segments, displayed over the
  time-frequency plane (Eq. 12.173 defines the unweighted magnitude
  version; this module computes the power version with the exact
  ``'density'``/``'spectrum'`` calibration of
  :func:`~phonometry.metrology.spectra.power_spectral_density`, so a
  signal in pascals reads directly in Pa²/Hz or Pa² and averaging the
  columns reproduces the Welch estimate bin by bin). Each cell trades the
  time resolution ``T_B = nperseg/fs`` against the frequency resolution
  ``1/T_B`` at a resolution-bandwidth-time product of one, so a single
  cell of random data is an unaveraged estimate: the power carries a
  normalized random error of ``1/√nd = 1`` with ``nd = 1`` (Eq. 8.158),
  and the magnitude display an error of ``√2/1.25 ≈ 1.13`` - the
  Rayleigh-ratio result Bendat & Piersol quote in Section 12.6.4.2.
  Deterministic structure (tones, sweeps, transients) is unaffected by
  that caveat and is what the spectrogram is for.

* the **zoom FFT** (Section 11.5.4): the spectrum of a narrow band
  ``[f_min, f_max]`` computed on an arbitrarily fine frequency grid
  without the giant FFT block a full-band analysis would need
  (Eq. 11.122). The book's procedure - bandpass, complex demodulation by
  ``exp(-j2πf₁t)``, decimation by ``d = k₂/(k₂-k₁)`` and an FFT of the
  decimated record (Eqs. 11.123-11.130) - is realized here in its exact
  single-pass digital equivalent, the chirp-Z evaluation of the DFT on
  the zoom grid (:func:`scipy.signal.zoom_fft`): both compute the same
  DFT samples of the record, which the test suite verifies to machine
  precision against the demodulate-decimate-DFT chain. The bin spacing
  can be made arbitrarily fine, but the true resolution stays set by the
  record length and taper (the reported effective noise bandwidth
  ``Bₑ = fs·Σw²/(Σw)²``): zooming refines the grid, only a longer record
  refines the resolution (Eq. 11.127).

Amplitudes are calibrated so that a sine of peak amplitude ``A`` on an
analysis frequency reads ``|spectrum| = A``, ``power = A²/2`` (its mean
square) - consistent with the ``'spectrum'`` scaling of the Welch module.
