// The redirect map is complete, current, and lands on real pages.
//
// Two page renames went out with no redirect behind them and nobody noticed
// for a month: /reference/why-phonometry/ was live and indexable from
// 2026-07-06 to 2026-08-03 and has answered 404 ever since, and
// /guides/room-acoustics/ has answered 404 since the taxonomy move. They were
// not special. 432 published addresses were in the same state, against eight
// redirect entries in the configuration. Nothing in the build looked: Astro
// does not know an address used to exist, and starlight-links-validator only
// reads the links the pages carry today.
//
// So this reads the history instead. It derives the map again from the renames
// git recorded and compares it with the committed file, which fails the moment
// a page moves without its old address following it; and, when a build is
// present, it checks the map against what was actually written to dist, so a
// redirect cannot point at a page that is not there or at another redirect.
//
// Usage: node scripts/check-redirects.mjs   (or `pnpm run check:redirects`)
