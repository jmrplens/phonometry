"""Turning the artefact into the Markdown the report is.

The Markdown is a pure function of ``docs/conformance.json``: this module
computes nothing and runs no check, it formats what the artefact already
decided. That is what lets ``docs/CONFORMANCE.md`` keep a byte gate while the
values behind it are compared within a tolerance - the bytes are derived from
bytes that are themselves committed, so two runs on different hardware render
the same file even when the underlying computation wobbles in its last digit.

It is also what makes the report testable on a three-check fixture instead of
only end to end on 552, and what stops the Markdown mirror and the site page
from ever disagreeing: both read one document.

The reader gets the headline count, the filters and weightings showcase, then
one collapsible section per domain in registration order. Only the committed
file also gets :data:`_DOC_HEADER`, the do-not-edit banner, so the pull-request
comment stays header-free.

The collapsing rule is the point of the layout: a section stays shut while
every one of its rows passes and springs open the moment one fails, so a long
green report reads as a single line and a regression is the only thing open on
the page. The escaping in :func:`_cell` exists for the same reason - an
unescaped ``|`` in a quantity written the way acousticians write it silently
drops the evidence columns off the right of the row.
