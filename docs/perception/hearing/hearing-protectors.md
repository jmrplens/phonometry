# Hearing Protectors (ISO 4869-2)

A hearing protector is not measured on a coupler. ISO 4869-1 seats it on at
least sixteen people and records the threshold shift each of them gets, so what
comes back from the laboratory is a **distribution**: one attenuation per
subject per octave band, with a spread that is often a third of the mean.
ISO 4869-2 is the standard that turns that distribution into a number someone
can act on, and the first thing it does is refuse to use the mean.

## The distribution first (Clause 5)

Every method starts from the assumed protection value, the mean attenuation
reduced by a multiple of its own spread:

$$
APV_{fx} = m_f - \alpha\, s_f
$$

$\alpha$ is the inverse standard normal cumulative distribution at the
protection performance $x$ (Table 1), so $APV_{f84}$ with $\alpha = 1$ is the
attenuation 84 % of wearers reach or beat, and $APV_{f98}$ with $\alpha = 2$ is
what all but one in fifty reach.

import numpy as np
from phonometry import hearing

# ISO 4869-1 attenuation: 16 subjects, eight octave bands from 63 Hz to 8 kHz.
attenuation = np.array([
    [4, 8, 13, 18, 20, 30, 35, 30],   [6, 12, 16, 21, 29, 35, 47, 35],
    [10, 16, 17, 23, 25, 32, 48, 37], [3, 7, 12, 18, 20, 25, 33, 30],

    [5, 6, 10, 13, 19, 22, 29, 28],   [9, 9, 10, 19, 20, 27, 37, 31],

], dtype=float)

apv = hearing.assumed_protection_value(attenuation)          # x = 84 % by default
print(np.round(apv.apv, 1))    # [ 4.1  6.4 10.7 14.9 18.8 23.4 31.3 28.9]

*Left, the protector: the assumed protection value sits a full standard
deviation below the mean, and the gap is widest where the spread is, at 4 kHz.
Right, the method: the HML line and the eight reference noises it was fitted
on, with the three methods' answers for the same noise.*

## Three methods, in decreasing order of what they need

**The octave-band method (Clause 6)** is the most faithful and the only one
that sees the shape of the noise: subtract the assumed protection value band by
band from the A-weighted spectrum and sum what is left (Formula (2)).

**The HML method (Clause 7)** collapses the protector to three numbers, the
predicted noise level reduction it gives for reference noises whose
$(L_{p,C} - L_{p,A})$ is $-2$, $+2$ and $+10$ dB, fitted across the eight
reference spectra of Table 2. Applying them needs only the C- and A-weighted
levels of the real noise, through two straight segments that meet at $+2$ dB.

**The SNR method (Clause 8)** collapses it to one number against a pink noise
and subtracts it from the C-weighted level.

```python
noise = [75.0, 84.0, 86.0, 88.0, 97.0, 99.0, 97.0, 96.0]   # LpA = 104, LpC = 103 dB
octave = hearing.octave_band_protected_level(noise, apv)
hml = hearing.hml_rating(attenuation)
snr = hearing.snr_rating(attenuation)

print(octave.reported_level)                                          # 81
print(hml.reported)                                                   # (24, 18, 13)
print(hearing.hml_protected_level(104.0, 103.0, hml).reported_level)  # 82
print(snr.reported)                                                   # 21
print(hearing.snr_protected_level(snr, l_p_c=103.0).reported_level)   # 82
```

The three answer the same question and rarely agree exactly: 81 dB, 82 dB and
82 dB for one protector in one noise. Clause 1's own NOTE puts differences of
3 dB or less between comparable protectors below the resolution of the
exercise. The ordering is not a ranking: the octave-band method uses more
information and is the one to prefer when the spectrum is available, while HML
and SNR exist precisely for when it is not.

The values that enter the HML and SNR applications are the **rounded** ones:
Clauses 7.2 and 8.2 round the ratings to the nearest integer, which is what a
protector is published with. The octave-band method starts at 63 Hz when both the
noise and the protector have data there and at 125 Hz when either does not
(Clause 6); the HML and SNR computations start at 125 Hz always.

One caution about the reference spectra: Annex C reprints Table 2 as its
Table C.1 and the reprint disagrees with the original in two cells. Table 2 is
the one that reproduces the annex's own worked results, and it is the one this
library carries; the discrepancy is registered in [ERRATA](../../ERRATA.md).

ISO 4869-2:2018, which defines the assumed protection value $APV_{fx}$
(Clause 5), the octave-band method (Clause 6), the $H$, $M$ and $L$ values
(Clause 7) and the single number rating $SNR$ (Clause 8). The attenuation they
all start from is measured to ISO 4869-1:2018.
