"""EASA ANP fleet database bridge for the ECAC Doc 29 airport-noise chain.

The ECAC Doc 29 method in :mod:`phonometry.aircraft.airport_noise` places an
aircraft's noise at a receiver from a Noise-Power-Distance (NPD) table and a
flight profile. Both come, for real aircraft types, from the **Aircraft Noise
and Performance (ANP)** database maintained by EUROCONTROL/EASA: per aircraft it
tabulates NPD curves (``LAmax`` and ``SEL`` versus slant distance for a set of
engine power settings, per operation mode) and default trajectories.

This module reads the ANP database tables (the semicolon-delimited CSV exports)
and exposes, for a given aircraft identifier and operation:

* :class:`AnpNpdCurves` -- the NPD curves (``LAmax``/``SEL`` versus distance for
  each tabulated power), with a ``.plot()``;
* :class:`AnpProfile` -- the default fixed-point trajectory as a Doc 29 flight
  path ``(N, 5)`` with the takeoff/landing ground-roll masks, with a ``.plot()``;
* :class:`AnpAircraft` -- the aircraft metadata plus convenience wiring
  (:meth:`AnpAircraft.event_level`, :meth:`AnpAircraft.noise_contour`) that feeds
  the NPD curves and the profile straight into the existing Doc 29 functions.

:func:`load_anp_database` returns an :class:`AnpDatabase`. Called without a path
it loads the full EASA ANP database (archive version 2.3) shipped with the
package (see ``aircraft/data/anp/PROVENANCE.md``); pointed at a directory it
reads any other ANP CSV export the user provides.

Aircraft whose default trajectory is published as *procedural steps* rather than
as fixed points are reached through :mod:`phonometry.aircraft.flight_performance`,
the ECAC Doc 29 Vol. 2 Appendix B performance model:
:meth:`AnpDatabase.flight_profile` flies the published procedure for an
aerodrome and its weather, and :meth:`AnpDatabase.procedural_profile` returns the
result as the same Doc 29 flight path the fixed-point bridge produces, so either
kind of profile feeds the same chain. NPD curves are available for every aircraft
regardless.

Source (clean-room, implemented from the published table format): EASA ANP
database v2.3 (2020) and the ECAC Doc 29 4th ed. Vol 2 NPD/profile conventions.
