Time synchronous averaging (TSA) of a periodic waveform in noise.

Time domain averaging extracts a repetitive signal of known period ``T``
from additive noise by ensemble-averaging successive length-``T`` blocks,
following P. D. McFadden, "A revised model for the extraction of periodic
waveforms by time domain averaging", *Mechanical Systems and Signal
Processing* 1(1) 1987, 83-95. Given a signal ``y(t) = x(t) + e(t)`` with
``x`` periodic in ``T`` and ``e`` asynchronous, the average

    ``a(t) = (1/N) Σ_{n=0}^{N-1} y(t + n·T)``   (McFadden Eq. 5)

reinforces every component synchronous with ``T`` and suppresses the rest.

**Two models, one implementation.** McFadden distinguishes the *existing*
comb-filter model from the *revised* model. In the frequency domain the
average is the multiplication of ``Y(f)`` by the comb filter (Eq. 8)

    ``C(f) = (1/N)·sin(N·π·f·T) / sin(π·f·T)``,

whose magnitude ``|C(f)| = |sin(N·π·f·T) / (N·sin(π·f·T))|`` is a Dirichlet
kernel: unity at every harmonic ``k/T`` (the teeth, Eq. 9, of unit height
regardless of ``N``) and zero at the nodes ``j/(N·T)`` with ``j`` not a
multiple of ``N``. That model assumes knowledge of ``y`` over infinite time
and produces a result that is not exactly periodic. McFadden's *revised*
model applies a rectangular window of width ``T`` in the time domain and
samples the transform in the frequency domain, so it needs only a finite
block of the signal and yields a result that is exactly periodic and can be
stored as a single period. The digital block average computed here, ``N``
consecutive periods of an integer number of samples reduced to one period,
*is* that revised model: the returned :attr:`period_waveform`, repeated,
is exactly periodic.

**Noise reduction.** Asynchronous noise of variance ``σ²`` averaged over
``N`` periods has residual variance ``σ²/N``: the residual standard
deviation falls as ``1/√N`` and the amplitude signal-to-noise ratio
improves by ``√N`` (a power reduction of ``10·log₁₀ N`` dB, reported as
:attr:`noise_reduction_db`).

**Choosing N (McFadden's revised-model correction).** Because a discrete
interfering tone at a *non-harmonic* order ``q = f·T`` is only attenuated,
not removed, its rejection is optimised by choosing ``N`` so that a comb
node lands exactly on it, i.e. the smallest ``N`` with ``N·q`` an integer.
McFadden's own example, a tone at 32.05 orders, is suppressed by more than
100 dB with ``N = 20`` (since ``20·32.05 = 641``) yet only ~14 dB with the
common power-of-two choice ``N = 32`` (``32·32.05 = 1025.6``). Thus the
habit of taking a power-of-two number of averages is not, in general,
optimal.

**Non-integer samples per period.** When ``fs·T`` is not an integer the
period boundaries fall between samples. Each block is then aligned to a
common integer grid by the band-limited fractional delay of
:func:`phonometry.metrology.signals.fractional_delay` before averaging, so
the periodic waveform is recovered within the interpolation error of that
band-limited shift. An integer ``fs·T`` needs no interpolation and the
waveform is recovered to machine precision.
