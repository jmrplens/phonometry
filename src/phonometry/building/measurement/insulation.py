r"""Field measurement of sound insulation: airborne (ISO 16283-1:2014), impact
(ISO 16283-2:2020) and facade (ISO 16283-3:2016).

**Field quantities (ISO 16283-1:2014).** From the energy-average sound
pressure levels in the source and receiving rooms this module forms the
level difference :math:`D = L_1 - L_2` (Clause 3.12, Formula (1)), the
standardized level difference :math:`D_\mathrm{nT} = D + 10 \log_{10}(T/T_0)` with the
reference reverberation time :math:`T_0 = 0.5` s (Clause 3.13,
Formula (2)), and the apparent sound reduction index
:math:`R' = D + 10 \log_{10}(S/A)` with the Sabine equivalent absorption area
:math:`A = 0.16 V / T` (Clause 3.14/3.15, Formula (4) and (5)). Source and
receiving levels may be supplied already averaged (one value per band) or
as several microphone positions, which are then energy-averaged with
:math:`10 \log_{10}\left( \frac{1}{n} \sum 10^{L_j/10} \right)` (Clause 7.8.1,
Formula (9)). The quantities are evaluated per one-third-octave band, the
caller having already applied any background-noise correction (Clause 9.2).

**Field impact quantities (ISO 16283-2:2020).** With the tapping machine as
the impact source this module forms, from the energy-average impact sound
pressure level ``Li`` in the receiving room, the standardized impact sound
pressure level :math:`L'_\mathrm{nT} = L_\mathrm{i} - 10 \log_{10}(T/T_0)` with
:math:`T_0 = 0.5` s (Clause
3.13, Formula (1)) and the normalized impact sound pressure level
:math:`L'_\mathrm{n} = L_\mathrm{i} + 10 \log_{10}(A/A_0)` (Clause 3.15,
Formula (3)) with the Sabine absorption area :math:`A = 0.16 V/T`
(Clause 3.14, Formula (2)) and the reference area :math:`A_0 = 10` m², which
Clause 3.15 defines as a term of that formula rather than giving it one of
its own.
Levels
may be supplied already averaged or as several microphone positions, then
energy-averaged (Clause 7.8.1, Formula (11)).

**Field façade quantities (ISO 16283-3:2016).** With an outdoor sound
source this module forms, from the level 2 m in front of the façade
``L1,2m`` and the receiving-room level ``L2``, the level difference
:math:`D_{2\mathrm{m}} = L_{1,2\mathrm{m}} - L_2` (Clause 3.14), its standardized form
:math:`D_{2\mathrm{m,nT}} = D_{2\mathrm{m}} + 10 \log_{10}(T/T_0)` with :math:`T_0 = 0.5` s
(Clause 3.15) and
normalized form :math:`D_{2\mathrm{m,n}} = D_{2\mathrm{m}} - 10 \log_{10}(A/A_0)` with the Sabine
absorption
area :math:`A = 0.16 V/T` (Clause 3.17) and reference :math:`A_0 = 10` m²
(Clause 3.16): the global loudspeaker / traffic quantities
``Dls,2m,*`` / ``Dtr,2m,*``. When a surface level ``L1,s`` (microphone on
the test element) with the element area ``S`` and volume are given it
forms the apparent sound reduction index
:math:`R'_{45^\circ} = L_{1,\mathrm{s}} - L_2 + 10 \log_{10}(S/A) - 1.5` for the
loudspeaker element method
(Clause 3.12) or :math:`R'_\mathrm{tr,s} = L_{1,\mathrm{s}} - L_2 + 10 \log_{10}(S/A) - 3` for
the
road-traffic element method (Clause 3.13). These quantities are defined by
unnumbered formulas inline in the Clause 3 terms; positions are
energy-averaged with the surface-level formula (Clause 9.5.1, Formula (7)).
The façade quantity is airborne, so its single-number rating uses the
**ISO 717-1 airborne** reference curve and method (Clause 2, Annex F)
unchanged, via :func:`weighted_rating`.

**Frequency range.** The three parts require the same 16 core one-third-octave
bands, 100 Hz to 3150 Hz (Part 1 and Part 3 Clause 5, Part 2 Clause 5.1), and
make the low range 50 Hz to 80 Hz and the high range 4000 Hz to 5000 Hz
optional additions. The functions below evaluate whatever bands they are given
and impose no range of their own; it is
:mod:`~phonometry.building.measurement.ratings` that fixes a range, taking
either those 16 one-third-octave bands or the 5 octave bands from 125 Hz to
2000 Hz, and the ``report()`` fiche that needs exactly the 16.

When the optional low range **is** measured, the low-frequency procedure of
:mod:`phonometry.building.measurement.low_frequency` becomes mandatory for the
50 Hz, 63 Hz and 80 Hz bands in any room whose volume, to the nearest cubic
metre, is under 25 m³. Each function below takes it through a
:class:`~.low_frequency.LowFrequencyProcedure`: ``source_low_frequency`` and
``receiver_low_frequency`` for the airborne pair of rooms, ``low_frequency``
for the single receiving room of the other two. Computing those three bands
from the default procedure alone in a room that small is not the ISO 16283
quantity, so a function handed the volume and the band centres without a
procedure raises a :class:`~.low_frequency.LowFrequencyWarning` rather than
answering silently. The one exception is the road-traffic façade, which
ISO 16283-3 Clause 6 gives the default procedure and nothing else.

The single-number rating of any of these curves is the subject of
:mod:`phonometry.building.measurement.ratings`, which implements ISO 717-1
(airborne) and ISO 717-2 (impact); the ``report()`` methods below call it to
box the rating on the field report form.

    :math:`D_\mathrm{nT} = D + 10 \log_{10}(T/T_0)` (Formula (2)) and, when the partition

    index :math:`R' = D + 10 \log_{10}(S/A)` with :math:`A = 0.16\,V/T`
    (Formula (4) and (5)).

    ``l1`` and ``l2`` may be one value per band (already energy-averaged)
    or a two-dimensional ``(positions, bands)`` array, in which case the
    positions are energy-averaged with Formula (9). The band levels are
    assumed already corrected for background noise (Clause 9.2).

    **Rooms under 25 m³.** Clause 8.1 makes the low-frequency procedure
    mandatory for the 50 Hz, 63 Hz and 80 Hz bands "in the source and/or
    receiving room when *its* volume is smaller than 25 m³ (calculated to the
    nearest cubic metre)", so the two rooms are tested independently and either
    may carry a :class:`~.low_frequency.LowFrequencyProcedure`. Whichever room
    carries one has its level at those three bands replaced by
    :math:`L_\mathrm{LF}` (Formula (13)) before ``D`` is formed. Clause 10.4 is
    a receiving-room clause alone, so the 63 Hz octave reverberation time is
    taken from ``receiver_low_frequency`` and required there: a small source
    room beside a large receiving room changes ``L1`` and leaves ``t2`` as
    measured. Note 4 to entry of Clause 3.14 records that ``R'`` determined
    this way no longer maps exactly onto the sound-power ratio of Formula (3).

    Clause 8.1 is a *shall*, so a receiving room that rounds below 25 m³ and a
    ``frequencies`` vector naming any of the three bands are together enough
    to know the procedure was owed. When ``receiver_low_frequency`` is then
    absent this function computes ``D`` from the default procedure alone and
    raises a :class:`~.low_frequency.LowFrequencyWarning` naming the bands it
    found. Only the receiving room, because only its
