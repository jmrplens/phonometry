r"""Weighting filters (A, B, C, D, G, AU, 468, Z), time weighting utilities
and the Linkwitz-Riley crossover.

A/C/Z per IEC 61672-1:2013; G (infrasound) per ISO 7196:1995.

B is the historical weighting of ANSI S1.4-1983 (Appendix C): the C curve
with one extra zero at the origin and one extra real pole at
:math:`f_5 = 158.48932` Hz. It was dropped from the sound-level-meter
standards
when IEC 61672-1 replaced IEC 60651 (first edition 2002) and is provided for
historical data and older national codes only.

AU per IEC 61012:1990: the A weighting cascaded with the U low-pass
(six poles, Table 2: a double real pole at -12 200 Hz and complex pairs at
-7 850 +/- j8 800 Hz and -2 900 +/- j12 150 Hz) for measuring audible sound
in the presence of ultrasound. It is flat relative to A up to 10 kHz and
cuts steeply above (U alone, Table 1: -2.8 dB at 12.5 kHz; -61.8 dB at
40 kHz). The Table 2 poles reproduce every Table 1 nominal value within
0.05 dB.

D per the withdrawn IEC 537:1976 (aircraft-noise weighting): implemented
from the widely published rational transfer function

.. math::

   \frac{k s \left( s^2 + 6532 s + 4.0975 \times 10^7 \right)}
        {(s + 1776.3)(s + 7288.5)
         \left( s^2 + 21514 s + 3.8836 \times 10^8 \right)}

with ``k`` renormalized to exactly 0 dB at
1 kHz. The standard itself is withdrawn and unavailable, so the constants
are corroborated against two independent implementations: SQAT
(``sound_level_meter/Gen_weighting_filters.m``: identical zeros and poles;
note its display-only ``freqResp`` line prints 1773.6 where its pole list,
and every other source, has 1776.3) and librosa (``librosa.D_weighting``,
an independent frequency-domain closed form; agreement within 0.002 dB
from 10 Hz to 20 kHz). The response also reproduces the tabulated IEC 537
curve republished in the NASA Handbook of Aircraft Noise Metrics
(NASA CR-3406, 1981, Table SLD-I) within 0.1 dB at every one-third-octave
frequency from 50 Hz to 10 kHz except 1600 Hz (0.15 dB) and 2500 Hz
(0.28 dB), where that table appears to round a different source curve.

468 per ITU-R BS.468-4, the psophometric weighting for audio-frequency
noise in sound broadcasting: a bandpass peaking at +12.22 dB near 6.3 kHz
and falling at about -30 dB/octave above 12.5 kHz, which is what makes
broadband noise audible in a programme chain rather than what makes it
loud. Clause 1 defines it as the response of the passive network of Fig. 1a,
so it is built from that network's seven printed component values
(:func:`_itu_r_468_prototype`) and reproduces all 21 rows of the Table 1
sampling to 0.0503 dB. Its skirt is steep enough that the design runs at a
384 kHz target rather than the module's 144 kHz default, and the plain
design at the input rate -- what stateful processing would use -- is
refused rather than shipped 23 dB out at 16 kHz.

One Table 1 row is out of reach at 44.1 kHz: 20 kHz sits at 0.91 of that
rate's Nyquist frequency, inside the anti-alias transition band the
resampling stages carry, and reads 2.1 dB low against a +/-2.0 dB
tolerance. Of that, the two anti-alias passes are -1.66 dB and the sections
only -0.49 dB, and the resampler's share does not move with the design rate:
its tap count grows as 20 L while its normalised cutoff falls as 1/L, so the
transition band in hertz is the same for every factor. Raising the factor
improves the row, but only by decompressing the sections, and it is already
at the module's cap of 8 at this rate. The ceiling therefore belongs to the
resampling path rather than to this curve, and the A weighting loses 2.25 dB
at the same point for the same reason. At 48 kHz and above every row below
Nyquist is inside the mask, the tightest margin being the 6.3 kHz peak.

            well clear of the input Nyquist frequency (fs >= 40 kHz). At
            48 kHz this oversamples x3, keeping the deviation from the design
            goal to -0.44 dB at the 16 kHz nominal frequency and -0.86 dB at
            the 20 kHz one. Oversampling cannot rescue the top of the band at
            low sample rates, because the resampling stages it adds around
            the sections carry an anti-alias transition band centred on the
            input Nyquist frequency: above roughly 0.9 x fs/2 the response
            rolls off steeply whatever the design rate. What the roll-off
            costs is per curve, since each is graded against its own design
            goal: at fs = 32 kHz the 15 848.9 Hz nominal point falls 16.2 dB
            below the A goal but 15.3 dB below the C one (class 1 allows
            -16.0 dB there, class 2 has no lower limit), so the verified
            class at 32 kHz is 2 for A and still 1 for C. At fs = 16 kHz the
            7 943.3 Hz point falls 12.0 dB below the A goal and 13.7 dB below
            the C one (class 1 allows -2.5 dB, class 2 -5.0 dB), so neither
            curve verifies to any class there. The plain bilinear
            design holds class 1 for fs >= 40 kHz (-2.8 dB at the 12.5 kHz
            nominal frequency at 48 kHz, -3.5 dB at 44.1 kHz, inside the
            +2.0/-5.0 class 1 limits), degrades to class 2 between 22.05 and
            32 kHz and meets no class at fs <= 20 kHz. Defaults to True
            except in stateful mode (the internal FIR resampling is
