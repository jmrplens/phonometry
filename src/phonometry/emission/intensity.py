Two-microphone (p-p) sound intensity per IEC 61043:1994 and the
ISO 9614-1:1993 field indicators.

A p-p probe holds two pressure microphones a fixed distance ``spacing``
(dr) apart. The mean of the two pressures is taken as the sound pressure
at the probe reference point, while the pressure differential is used to
derive the particle velocity component along the probe axis
(IEC 61043:1994, definition 3.2)::

    p(t) = (p1(t) + p2(t)) / 2
    u(t) = -(1 / (rho * dr)) * integral of (p2(t) - p1(t)) dt
    I    = < p(t) * u(t) >          (time average)

For stationary signals the time-averaged intensity reduces to the
imaginary part of the one-sided cross spectrum G12 of the two microphone
pressures (the frequency-domain form of the same finite-difference
estimator)::

    I(f) = -Im{G12(f)} / (2 * pi * f * rho * dr)

The finite-difference gradient underestimates the true plane-wave
intensity by the factor ``sin(k*dr) / (k*dr)`` with ``k = 2*pi*f/c``;
IEC 61043:1994 clause 7.3 specifies the probe intensity response with
exactly this argument (``Ff = dr * f * 2 * pi / c``) and Table 3 lists
the resulting nominal response (e.g. -10,5 dB at 6,3 kHz for a 25 mm
separation). Below ``f = 0,1 * c / dr`` (k*dr < 0,63) the bias stays
under about 0,3 dB (factor >= 0,935).

Field indicators F2 (surface pressure-intensity), F3 (negative partial
power) and F4 (field non-uniformity) follow ISO 9614-1:1993 Annex A
(normative), equations (A.3)-(A.9). The dynamic capability index is
``Ld = delta_pI0 - K`` (ISO 9614-1 clause 3.12, equation (10)); the
instrument is adequate for a measurement when ``Ld > F2`` (criterion 1,
Annex B equation (B.1)).

    Sound intensity from a two-microphone (p-p) probe (IEC 61043:1994).

    The one-sided cross spectrum ``G12`` of the two microphone pressures
    is estimated with Welch-averaged, Hann-windowed segments
    (:func:`scipy.signal.csd`) and converted to the intensity spectral
    density along the probe axis (definition 3.2 of IEC 61043:1994 gives
    the underlying p-p formulation)::

        I(f) = -Im{G12(f)} / (2 * pi * f * rho * spacing)

    Positive intensity flows from microphone 1 towards microphone 2.
    The mean-square pressure is taken from the mean signal
    ``(p1 + p2)/2`` at the probe reference point. When ``fraction`` is
    given, both quantities are integrated into octave (1) or one-third
    octave (3) bands using the ANSI S1.11/IEC 61260-1 band edges of
    :func:`phonometry.nominal_frequencies`; bands without any spectral
    bin are dropped. Broadband totals are always computed (over
    ``limits`` when provided, otherwise over all positive frequencies).

    The pressure-intensity index ``Lp - LI`` is reported per band and
    broadband; in a free plane progressive wave it equals
    ``10*lg(rho*c/400)`` = 0,14 dB (IEC 61043:1994 clause 5 note), while
    large values flag reactive or noisy fields (compare with the
    instrument dynamic capability, ISO 9614-1:1993 criterion 1).

    Usable bandwidth: the finite-difference gradient biases the result
    by the factor ``sin(k*spacing)/(k*spacing)`` (IEC 61043:1994, 7.3);
    results are essentially unbiased (< ~0,3 dB) below
    ``max_valid_frequency = 0,1 * c / spacing``, and ``bias_correction``
    provides the per-band compensation factor.

        totals, so the totals no longer under-read as the frequency approaches
        ``max_valid_frequency``. The reciprocal diverges as ``k*spacing -> pi``
        (the first spatial-aliasing null at ``c/(2*spacing)``, inside the
        default band range for close spacings), so it is applied only over the
        probe's usable range — up to ``k*spacing = pi/2`` — and held constant
        beyond, keeping the totals bounded instead of letting a few near-null
        bins dominate them. Default False keeps the exact legacy totals; the
        per-band ``bias_correction`` factor (same clamped definition) is
        reported either way.
