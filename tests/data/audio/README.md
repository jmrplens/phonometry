# Real measurement audio — functional oracles with published values

Third-party measurement recordings and series derived from them, included in
this repository **for validation only**: each file comes with a value its
authors published, and the test suite computes that value through the
library's own reading and measurement chain. They are test data, not part of
the `phonometry` package; they are not installed with it, and this
repository's MIT licence does **not** cover them — the licences named below
do. The general rules for committed oracle data are in `tests/data/README.md`.

### `xl2/` — NTi XL2 pass-by campaign, University of Antwerp (CC BY 4.0)

Attribution: **"Calibration file and pass-by excerpts from: A. Grangeiro de
Barros and C. Vuye, 'Psychoacoustic indicators of pass-by road traffic
noise', Zenodo, 2023. DOI 10.5281/zenodo.7904680. Licensed CC BY 4.0
(https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Recorded with an NTi Audio
XL2 sound level meter."** Retrieved from the Zenodo deposit on
2026-08-18 (archive checksum verified against the record).

- `calibration_113_7dB.wav` is byte-identical to `Calibration file 1Hz
  113.7 dB.wav` of the deposit (renamed here; the "1Hz" of the original
  name is the depositors' typo for the 1 kHz calibrator tone). PCM 24-bit
  mono 48 kHz, written by the meter itself: the `bext` chunk carries
  `Originator "NTi Audio XL2 A2A-17367-E0"` and `Description "0dBFS =
  129.3 dBSPL"`. Published value: the deposit names and describes it as
  the **113.7 dB** calibration recording of the campaign's sound level
  meter and microphone.
- `passby_*.wav` are five 4-second pass-by excerpts (one per vehicle
  category and speed named in the file name), cut **bit-exactly** (whole
  24-bit sample codes, unmodified) from the campaign's hour-long session
  recordings at the sample ranges given by the deposit's timestamp
  workbooks, and repackaged in a minimal `fmt `+`data` RIFF container.
  The session `bext` chunks are deliberately not copied into the cuts, so
  no instrument metadata is misattributed to an excerpt the instrument
  did not write; each session's digital full scale (0 dBFS = 129.4 or
  129.5 dB SPL) is transcribed in the consuming test instead, next to the
  published values it calibrates. **Changes with respect to the original
  files: cut and recontainered as described; sample data unmodified.**
  Published values: the deposit's master workbook `Psychoacoustic
  indicators of pass-by road traffic noise.xlsx` lists, per pass-by,
  LA,eq, LA,max, L10 and the median Zwicker loudness N50 computed by the
  authors; the five rows used (indices 566, 571, 668, 960 and 1558) are
  transcribed in the consuming test.

### `sounddevices/` — wavinfo test file (MIT)

Attribution: **"A101_3.WAV from the wavinfo project
(https://github.com/iluvcapra/wavinfo), MIT License, Copyright (c)
2018-2023 Jamie Hardt."** Retrieved from the wavinfo repository on
2026-08-18.

A real BWF written by a Sound Devices 702T field recorder: `bext` version 1
with every string field populated by the machine, plus a 5.2 kB `iXML`
chunk. Byte-identical to `tests/test_files/sounddevices/A101_3.WAV` of the
wavinfo repository. The wavinfo documentation documents this recorder's
`bext` output on the sibling take `A101_1.WAV`; the expected field values
for this file are transcribed in the consuming test and were cross-read
with an independent reader (ffprobe) at import time.

### `libbw64/` — EBU libbw64 test file (Apache License 2.0)

Attribution: **"rect_24bit_rf64.wav from the EBU libbw64 project
(https://github.com/ebu/libbw64), Apache License 2.0

libbw64 repository on 2026-08-18.

A genuine RF64 file (`RF64` FourCC with a `ds64` chunk), PCM 24-bit
44.1 kHz stereo, byte-identical to `tests/test_data/rect_24bit_rf64.wav` of
the libbw64 repository. It is the small real-world RF64 the reader is
validated against; the expected sample codes of its rectangular wave are
asserted exactly.

### `nikolauskapelle/` — St. Nicholas Chapel RIR, FH Aachen (CC BY 4.0)

Attribution: **"Omnidirectional channel of the S1-Do_R1 impulse response
from: M. Zerwas and S. Kayku, 'Room acoustic measurement and simulation

Zenodo deposit on 2026-08-18.

`s1_do_r1_w.npz` holds the W (omnidirectional) channel of the B-format
impulse response `S1-Do_R1.wav` from the deposit's
`impulse_responses.zip`, as `w` (float32 samples exactly as stored in the
original file) and `fs` (48000). **Changes with respect to the original
file: one channel of four extracted and repackaged as npz; sample data
unmodified.** Published values: the deposit's workbook
`Nikolauskapelle_Source1_Results_20260205.xlsx` tabulates the ISO 3382-1
room acoustic parameters (EDT, T20, T30, C80, C50, D50, Ts) of this
source-receiver pair per one-third-octave band; the rows used are
transcribed in the consuming test.

### `dublin/` — DCC Ambient Sound Monitoring Network (CC BY 4.0)

Attribution: **"Five-minute LAeq series from the Dublin City Council
Ambient Sound Monitoring Network (Ballymun and Ringsend monitors, 2015),
Smart Dublin / data.gov.ie open data, dataset 'Ambient Sound Monitoring

data.gov.ie on 2026-08-18, together with the annual report from
dublincity.ie.

`dcc_laeq_5min_2015.npz` is a derived series, not audio: for each site,
`<site>_time0_s` (first interval-end stamp, in seconds since 2015-01-01
00:00 local time), `<site>_dt_s` (differences between consecutive stamps)
and `<site>_laeq_cdb` (the five-minute A-weighted Leq values in hundredths
of a dB, an exact transcription of the two-decimal source). **Changes with
respect to the original files: the daily text logs were concatenated,
sorted, de-duplicated (49 stamps re-measured around a monitor restart on
2015-05-15 keep their first value) and repacked as npz; the level values
are unmodified.** Published values: the DCC "Ambient Sound Monitoring
Network Annual Report For 2015" (dublincity.ie), p. 11, gives the annual
night-time (23:00-07:00) levels — Ballymun **58 dB(A)**, Ringsend
**59 dB(A)** — with logarithmic (energetic) averaging declared.

## Purpose and scope of use

These files exist so that the reading chain (`phonometry.io`) and the
measurement functions can be validated end to end against **real recordings
with independently published values**, in CI, without any local download.
Every licence above permits redistribution: two deposits and the Dublin
series under CC BY 4.0 (attribution given here, changes indicated above),
one file under MIT and one under Apache License 2.0 (notices preserved
here). What is deliberately **not** committed: the campaigns' full
recordings (13.2 GB of pass-by audio, the 271 MB impulse-response set),
the deposits' workbooks, and the four-channel version of the RIR — the
tests transcribe the handful of published numbers they assert instead.

## Removal policy

If you are an author or rights holder of any of these datasets and consider
that this redistribution exceeds the intended use, please open an issue or
contact the maintainer (see `CITATION.cff`) and the file will be removed
promptly. Each file is consumed by exactly one test module (table above),
which would be removed with it; nothing else in the repository depends on
this folder.
