Field survey method for sound insulation and service-equipment noise
(ISO 10052:2021).

This is the **survey (control) method**: a fast, octave-band field procedure
for dwellings and rooms of comparable size (up to 150 m³). It trades the
resolution of the ISO 16283 engineering method ([`phonometry.insulation`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/))
for speed: a single hand-held integrating sound level meter swept through the
room. It measures airborne and impact sound insulation between rooms, façade
sound insulation, and the sound pressure level from building service equipment.
Clause references and the reverberation-index table follow the 2021 edition;
the formulas and that table are identical in the harmonized
EN ISO 10052:2004+A1:2010.

**Reverberation index (Clause 3.3).** The correction for the receiving room is
carried by a single quantity, the reverberation index `k = 10 lg(T/T0)` dB
with the reference reverberation time `T0 = 0,5 s`. It may be **measured** (pass
the reverberation time `T` per band to [`reverberation_index`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/survey-insulation/#reverberation_index)) or,
in a control survey, **estimated** from the room type and volume with
[`estimate_reverberation_index`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/survey-insulation/#estimate_reverberation_index) (Clause 6.5, Tables 3 and 4).

**Airborne between rooms (Clauses 3.2-3.6).** From the source- and
receiving-room levels `L1` and `L2` the level difference `D = L1 - L2`
(Clause 3.2) gives the standardized level difference `DnT = D + k`
(Clause 3.4), the normalized level difference `Dn = D + k +
10 lg(A0 T0 / (0,16 V))` (Clause 3.5, `A0 = 10 m²`) and, when a common
partition area `S` is given, the apparent sound reduction index
`R' = D + k + 10 lg(S T0 / (0,16 V))` (Clause 3.6). Where `V/7,5 > S` the
value `V/7,5` is used for `S`, with `V` the smaller room.

**Impact (Clauses 3.7-3.9).** From the impact level `Li` (Clause 3.7,
energy-averaged over the tapping-machine positions; the 2021 edition also
admits the heavy/soft impact source of Clause 3.10 with the maximum level
`Li,Fmax` of Clause 3.11) the standardized impact level `L'nT = Li - k`
(Clause 3.8) and the normalized impact level `L'n = Li - k -
10 lg(A0 T0 / (0,16 V))` (Clause 3.9).

**Façade (Clauses 3.13-3.15).** From the outdoor level 2 m in front of the
façade `L1,2m` and the receiving-room level `L2` the façade level
difference `D2m = L1,2m - L2` (Clause 3.13), the standardized
`D2m,nT = D2m + k` (Clause 3.14) and the normalized
`D2m,n = D2m + k + 10 lg(A0 T0 / (0,16 V))` (Clause 3.15).

**Service equipment (Clauses 3.16-3.18).** From three A- or C-weighted sound
pressure levels (one near a room corner, two in the reverberant field) the
service-equipment level `LXY = 10 lg[(1/3) sum 10^(0,1 LXY,i)]`
(Clause 3.16), its standardized form `LXY,nT = LXY - k` (Clause 3.17) and
normalized form `LXY,n = LXY - k - 10 lg(A0 T0 / (0,16 V))` (Clause 3.18).

**Frequency range (Clause 6.4).** Airborne and tapping-machine impact
quantities are measured in octave bands 125 Hz to 2000 Hz (5 bands); the
heavy/soft impact source uses 63 Hz to 500 Hz. The single-number weighted
ratings reuse the verified [`phonometry.weighted_rating`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#weighted_rating) (ISO 717-1) and
[`phonometry.weighted_impact_rating`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#weighted_impact_rating) (ISO 717-2) engines, formed only when
exactly 5 octave (or 16 one-third-octave) values are supplied. No background
correction is applied (Clause 6.2).

## estimate_reverberation_index

```python
estimate_reverberation_index(
    volume: float,
    room: str,
    *,
    weighted: bool = False,
) -> np.ndarray | float
```

Estimate the reverberation index from room type and volume (Clause 6.5).

In a control survey the reverberation time need not be measured: the
reverberation index `k` may be read from ISO 10052:2021 Table 4 (Table 3
of EN ISO 10052:2004+A1:2010) by classifying the room. Furnished rooms use
the `room` categories `"kitchen"` / `"bathroom"` (tabulated only for
`V < 35`) and `"furnished"` (a general furnished living/sleeping room);
unfurnished rooms use the Table 3 (2004: Table 2) construction letters
`"a"`-`"h"` and the area-averaged mixed classes `"a+e"`, `"b+f"`,
`"c+g"` and `"d+h"`. The table is valid for `T0 = 0,5 s` and rooms up
to 150 m³.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `volume` | Receiving-room volume `V`, in m³ (0 \< V \<= 150). |
| `room` | Room-type key (see above). |
| `weighted` | When `True` return the single A-/C-weighted index (the Table 4 `A, C` column) instead of the five octave-band values, for globally weighted service-equipment noise (Clause 3.17). |

**Returns:** The reverberation index `k` per octave band (125-2000 Hz), in dB, or the scalar A-/C-weighted index when `weighted` is `True`.

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | If `volume` is not in `(0, 150]`, or `room` is not tabulated for that volume range. |

difference `Dn = D + k + 10 lg(A0 T0 / (0,16 V))` (Clause 3.5). When a
common-partition `area` is also given, the apparent sound reduction index
`R' = D + k + 10 lg(S T0 / (0,16 V))` (Clause 3.6) is formed, using
`V/7,5` for `S` where that exceeds the given area (Clause 3.6). The
reverberation index `k` comes from [`reverberation_index`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/survey-insulation/#reverberation_index) (measured
`T`) or a Clause 6.5 estimate.
