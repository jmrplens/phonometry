// The structured data the site actually publishes.
//
// Every page carries a JSON-LD graph: the site-wide Person / WebSite /
// SoftwareApplication / SoftwareSourceCode nodes from astro.config.mjs, and a
// per-page article and breadcrumb trail from src/components/Head.astro. It is
// the only part of a page written for machines alone, and nothing in this
// repository read it. html-validate does not look inside a <script>, pa11y has
// no reason to, and the link checker sees no links there: a graph could stop
// being JSON, lose a required field or point at nothing at all and every check
// in the pipeline would stay green.
//
// It did. `Head.astro` resolved the section name from a map written out by
// hand beside the topic list, the signal chapter was renamed `signals` and
// only the list was swept, so all 54 pages of the signal analysis topic
// shipped with no `articleSection` for as long as nobody looked. The
// breadcrumb trail on those same pages named the section correctly throughout,
// because it reads src/data/topics.mjs.
//
// So this check reads topics.mjs too, and the built HTML, and nothing else: it
// derives what each page should say from its own URL and asserts it against
// what the page emits. A check that read Head.astro's idea of the answer would
// have agreed with the defect.
//
