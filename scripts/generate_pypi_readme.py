"""Generate README_PYPI.md, the PyPI long description, from README.md.

Two rewrites, for two things a package page does that a repository page
does not.

**Images.** PyPI's readme renderer strips ``<picture>``/``<source>``
elements, so the GitHub README's theme-aware images would degrade there.
Each ``<picture>`` element collapses down to its plain light-theme ``<img>``
fallback, and animated GIFs are swapped for their static ``_poster.jpg``
stills so the package page stays light to load.

**Links.** A PyPI description is frozen at upload and can never be edited
again, while ``main`` keeps moving under it. Every ``blob/main`` and
``raw.githubusercontent.com/.../main`` URL the README carries therefore
resolves against a tree that no longer matches the release the reader is
looking at, and the whole guide map rots the first time the documentation
is reorganised: the description published with 3.3.0 pointed at a flat
``docs/`` layout and 34 of its 38 repository links were dead within one
release. So the links are pinned here, at generation time, to ``blob/v``
plus the contents of the repository-root ``VERSION`` file: the published
page points at the tree it was published from, and stays right forever
because that tree never changes again.

That pin is right on the page PyPI serves and wrong on the copy committed
here, which is a build input rather than a page to read from ``main``. The
release workflow cuts the tag from the commit that lands the ``VERSION`` bump,
so the committed file is always in one of two states:

* **At the release commit, and only there.** ``VERSION`` has just been bumped,
  the pinned tag does not exist yet, and the paths behind it are right because
  this tree is what the tag is about to point at. The URLs 404 for the minutes
  it takes the workflow to create it.
* **For the whole rest of the cycle**, which is where ``main`` sits almost
  always. ``VERSION`` still names the last release, so the pinned tag exists
  and its tree is older than the README the page was generated from, and every
  path added or moved since that release 404s. ``v3.3.0`` predates the
  documentation reorganisation: measured against ``git ls-tree -r v3.3.0``, 86
  of the 95 paths on today's page are absent from it, the banner at the top of
  the page included.

Neither state ever reaches PyPI, because the page is regenerated at the
release commit and the tag is cut from that same commit. That is the property
the packaging tests hold, and it is why they resolve the pinned paths against
**this checkout** rather than over the network: the working tree is the tree
the tag will be cut from, so it answers the only question that decides whether
the published page is right. It says nothing about the tag already on the
remote, and the second state above is therefore ungated by design. Anything
that checks these URLs over HTTP has to skip this file in both states.

Run through ``make pypi-readme``; the packaging tests fail if the committed
file drifts from the README or from ``VERSION``.
