"""Assert that the numba-jitted impulse kernel really compiles, and warm its cache.

The CI job that installs the ``perf`` extra exists to exercise the compiled
kernel, so a silent fall back to the interpreted path (numba missing from the
environment, ``NUMBA_DISABLE_JIT`` left at its default, a decorator that stops
being applied) would leave the job green while testing nothing it is there for.
Run this before the suite: it fails loudly when no machine code was produced.

It has to run under the same environment as the suite it guards, which is why
the job declares ``NUMBA_DISABLE_JIT`` once for every step. The variable is
checked explicitly rather than inferred from whether compilation happened:
numba's own default is JIT on, but ``tests/conftest.py`` turns it off unless
the value is set, so a guard that only looked at the compiled signatures would
pass with the variable absent while the suite ran entirely interpreted.

Compiling here also fills numba's on-disk cache next to the module, so the
parallel test workers started afterwards load the kernel instead of each
compiling its own copy.
