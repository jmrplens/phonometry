"""The unreadable-annotation gate, measured on figures built to be measured.

``scripts/figure_annotation_audit.py`` answers two questions -- how many pixels
of a label's letters does a stroke paint under them, and how many never reach
the page at all -- and every interesting case is a way of getting one of them
wrong: a box a curve enters through the air above the letters, a curve that
stops on the edge of the box, a rule whose coordinates are 0.0 and 1.0 in a
blended transform, a marker series with nothing drawn between its markers, a
curve on the axes next door, a stem that is not a ``Line2D``, a chip the curve
is drawn over. Each figure below is one of those, small enough that the
expected answer is obvious by construction.

Then the ways an artist hides from a walk of the figure, which are the ways a
defect ships silently: an annotation holds its own arrow, ``inset_axes`` files
its result under the host, a figure draws its own text after every panel, and a
3-D plate projects its labels inside their own draw. Each has a synthetic here,
and the arrow has two, because an arrow pointing at its own curve is the
pattern the gate looks *for*.

And the property the whole design rests on: the measurement runs on the live
figure that is about to be written to disk, so it has to put every artist back.
That one is pinned on the rendered bytes.

``scripts/check_figure_annotations.py`` is then the arithmetic on top: the
gate, the advisory band, the exemptions and their staleness, and the command
line where the refusals live.
