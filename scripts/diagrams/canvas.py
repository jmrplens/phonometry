"""The sheet the diagrams are drawn on: theme, canvas and the writing of files.

One subject because a builder never sees anything else. :class:`Theme`
fixes the palette, and the light and dark instances of it are the same
colours the matplotlib figures use, so the docs can theme-switch an SVG
exactly like a raster plot. :class:`SVG` is the element accumulator with
the technical-drawing helpers a setup diagram needs (dimension lines,
microphones on stands, people, hatched ground). :func:`_write` renders a
builder the four ways the documentation embeds it: English and Spanish,
each light and dark.

    letters split by case at every level: lowercase are italic variables
    (``$θ$``, ``$η_{ij}$``) and capitals are upright (``$ΔL_s$``,
    ``$Δ_{SOR}$``, ``$Φ$``) -- in this corpus a capital Greek letter is an
    operator or a descriptor, matching the roman Δ of difference of ISO
    80000-2, the ``Δ_SOR`` print of ECAC Doc 29 §4.5.7 and the upright
    ``\\Delta`` matplotlib's mathtext sets in the figures. The
