# Multiple and partial coherence (Bendat & Piersol)

When several partially correlated sources drive one response, the ordinary
coherence of each source with the output is misleading: a source that only
*correlates* with the true cause inherits a spurious coherence through it, so
reading the ordinary coherences alone can credit the wrong source. Bendat &
Piersol, *Random Data* (4th ed., 2010, Chapter 7), resolve this for a
multiple-input/single-output (MISO) system with the **multiple** and
**partial** coherence functions. `miso_coherence` computes them from the same
Welch cross-spectral core as the rest of `phonometry.metrology`, for two or
three inputs and one output.

## 1. Ordinary, multiple and partial coherence

For a system with `q` inputs `x1..xq` and output `y`, `miso_coherence`
estimates every auto- and cross-spectrum by Welch's method and reports three
coherence functions.

The **ordinary coherence** of input `i` with the output, on its own
(Eq. 7.109), is the familiar single-input quantity
`γ²iy = |Giy|²/(Gii·Gyy)`.

The **multiple coherence** (Eq. 7.35) is the fraction of the output
autospectrum linearly explained by *all* inputs jointly,
`γ²y:x = GxyᴴGxx⁻¹Gxy/Gyy = 1 - Gnn/Gyy`, where `Gnn` is the residual output
spectrum uncorrelated with every input. If the output carries additive
uncorrelated noise of per-band signal-to-noise ratio `SNR`, this is exactly
`SNR/(1+SNR)`, the closed-form oracle used to verify the implementation.

The **partial coherence** of input `i` (Eq. 7.87),
`γ²iy·(i-1)! = |Giy·(i-1)!|²/(Gii·(i-1)!·Gyy)`, is its coherence with the
output once the linear effect of the inputs *before it in the conditioning
order* has been removed. The 4th-edition definition keeps the *total* output
`Gyy` in the denominator, so the partial coherences of the ordered inputs sum
to the multiple coherence (Eq. 7.116) and reduce exactly to the ordinary
coherences when the inputs are mutually uncorrelated (Eq. 7.117).

```python
res = miso_coherence([x1, x2], y, fs)
res.ordinary_coherence   # shape (q, F): each input on its own
res.multiple_coherence   # shape (F,):  all inputs jointly
res.partial_coherence    # shape (q, F): conditioned on the preceding inputs
```

## 2. Conditioning: separating cause from correlation

The partial coherences come from the **conditioned spectra** `Gij·r!`,
computed by the Gaussian-elimination recursion of Section 7.3. Removing the
linear effect of a pivot input `r` from every remaining record is one Schur
complement step (Eq. 7.94),
`Gij·r! = Gij·(r-1)! - Grj·(r-1)!·Gir·(r-1)!/Grr·(r-1)!`, applied for each
input in the conditioning order until only the residual output spectrum
`Gyy·q!` remains. In the figure above, input 2 is `0.7·x1 + independent
noise`, so it correlates with input 1 but drives no low-frequency path. Its
ordinary coherence with the output therefore reads about 0.3 across the low
band, borrowed entirely through input 1, while its partial coherence collapses
to zero there once input 1 is conditioned out.

```python
low = (res.frequencies > 100.0) & (res.frequencies < 300.0)
res.ordinary_coherence[1][low].mean()   # ~0.32  (inflated through x1)
res.partial_coherence[1][low].mean()    # ~0.00  (x1 removed)
```

## 3. Which source dominates each band

The conditioning also splits the output power source by source. The **partial
coherent output spectrum** of input `i` (Eq. 7.86), `Gvi = γ²iy·(i-1)!·Gyy`,
is the share of the output autospectrum it contributes, and the shares plus
the residual noise reconstruct the output exactly (Eqs. 7.88/7.121):
`sum(Gvi) + Gnn = Gyy`. Comparing the shares band by band answers "which
source dominates here?". `dominant_input()` returns, for every frequency, the
index of the input with the largest share.

```python
res.coherent_output_spectra        # shape (q, F): Gvi per input
dominant = res.dominant_input()    # index of the strongest source per bin
f = res.frequencies
dominant[np.argmin(abs(f - 200.0))]    # 0 (input 1 drives the low band)
dominant[np.argmin(abs(f - 2500.0))]   # 1 (input 2 drives the high band)
```

## 4. Statistical quality and the conditioning order

The random errors follow Section 9.3. Conditioning on the `i-1` preceding
inputs costs `i-1` degrees of freedom, so the `i`-th ordered input carries
`nd-(i-1)` effective averages (Eqs. 9.100/9.101) and the `q`-input multiple
coherence carries `nd-(q-1)` (Eq. 9.98). The result exposes
`multiple_coherence_random_error` and `coherent_output_random_error` alongside
the effective average count `n_averages`.

The ordinary and multiple coherences do not depend on the conditioning order,
but the partial coherences and the coherent-output decomposition do. Absent a
physical ordering, Bendat & Piersol (Section 7.2.4) recommend ordering the
inputs by descending ordinary coherence with the output; pass `order` to
choose (for example `order=(2, 0, 1)`). The estimators share the Welch core of
the [calibrated spectral analysis](spectral-analysis.md) page, so a MISO
coherence and a `power_spectral_density` computed with the same segment length
are consistent bin by bin.
