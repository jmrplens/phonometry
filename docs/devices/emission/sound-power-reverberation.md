# Sound Power in the Reverberation Room (ISO 3741)

A reverberation room turns its main defect as a listening space into a
measuring instrument: because the field is diffuse, a handful of microphone
positions sample the whole radiated energy, and the sound power follows from
the mean room level and the room's absorption with no enveloping surface to
build. That is why ISO 3741 is a grade-1 (precision) method, and why it is
the laboratory route of choice for steady, broadband sources small enough to
travel to a qualified room. This guide covers the direct method through the
Sabine absorption area, the Waterhouse and meteorological corrections, the
comparison method against a reference sound source, the qualification
warnings, the accredited-style test fiche and, in section 3, the sound energy
level $L_J$ that the same two methods give a single event. Which route fits
which job, and the pressure and intensity alternatives, are weighed in
[Sound Power](sound-power.md).

## 1. Reverberation room, precision grade (ISO 3741)

In a qualified hard-walled **reverberation room** the field is diffuse, so a
handful of microphones sample the whole radiated energy and the method
reaches grade 1. The sound power comes from the mean room level
$L_p(\text{ST})$, the Sabine absorption area
$A = (55.26/c)\cdot(V/T_{60})$ and a chain of small corrections
(ISO 3741 Eq. 20):

$$
L_W = \bar{L}_p + 10 \log_{10}\frac{A}{A_0} + 4.34\ \frac{A}{S}
      + 10 \log_{10}\left( 1 + \frac{S c}{8 V f} \right) + C_1 + C_2 - 6 .
$$

The bracketed term is the **Waterhouse correction**: near the room
boundaries the sound energy density is higher than in the interior, and
this term (which vanishes as frequency grows) restores the energy the
interior microphones miss. $C_1$ (reference-quantity) and $C_2$
(radiation-impedance) carry the result to the reference meteorological
conditions of 23 °C and 101.325 kPa,

$$
C_1 = -10 \log_{10}\frac{p_\mathrm{s}}{p_{\mathrm{s}0}} + 5 \log_{10}\frac{273.15 + \theta}{314}, \qquad
C_2 = -10 \log_{10}\frac{p_\mathrm{s}}{p_{\mathrm{s}0}} + 15 \log_{10}\frac{273.15 + \theta}{296},
$$

with the speed of sound $c = 20.05\sqrt{273 + \theta}$. The
**comparison method** replaces the absorption-area, Waterhouse and $C_1$
terms by a reference sound source of known power $L_W(\text{RSS})$ measured
in the same room, so the room need not be characterised:
$L_W = L_W(\text{RSS}) + (L_p(\text{ST}) - L_p(\text{RSS}) + C_2)$.

The right-hand panel of the clip below is this method. The same source runs
in both rooms; in the anechoic room on the left the microphones see only what
the source sends their way, so the level falls with distance and the
free-field route has to integrate over a measurement surface, while in the
reverberation room on the right the reflected energy fills the space and the
level stops depending on where a microphone is. That is the whole reason
Eq. 20 can replace a surface integral with a handful of positions and a room
constant — and the reason the room, not the array, is what has to be
qualified. Both routes end on the same $L_W$, because sound power is a
property of the source and not of the room it is measured in.

`levels` may be a 1D mean spectrum or a 2D `(NM, NB)` array averaged over
positions. When the room volume, its reverberation time or the microphone
count fail an ISO 3741 qualification criterion (Table 1 minimum volume, the
$V/S$ reverberation floor, fewer than 6 positions, or an inter-position
spread above 1.5 dB), an advisory `SoundPowerWarning` is emitted and the
result still returns. Those coarse advisory criteria are the only checks
made: the reverberation-room qualification itself (Annex C/D,
eigenfrequency counting or a reference-source comparison) is assumed, not
performed. The sound energy level $L_J$ of clause 9.2, the single-event
counterpart of $L_W$ defined in the same clauses, is section 3.

### `sound_power_reverberation()` parameters

| Parameter | Type | Units | Range / default | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `levels` | 1D or 2D array | dB | per band, or `(NM, NB)` | Mean room SPL; 2D is energy-averaged over positions |
| `t60` | float or 1D array | s | > 0 | Room reverberation time (scalar broadcasts) |
| `volume` | float | m³ | > 0 | Room volume $V$ |
| `surface_area` | float | m² | > 0 | Total room surface $S$ (Waterhouse, $A/S$) |
| `frequencies` | 1D array | Hz | one per band | Required (Waterhouse needs $f$); enables $L_{W\mathrm{A}}$ |
| `background_levels` | 1D or 2D array | dB | matches `levels` | $K_{1i}$ per microphone position (Eq. 14/15, before the Eq. 16 average; frequency-dependent criterion) |
| `temperature` | float | °C | default `23.0` | Sets $c$, $C_1$, $C_2$ |
| `static_pressure` | float | kPa | default `101.325` | Sets $C_1$, $C_2$ |

`sound_power_comparison(levels, levels_ref, lw_ref, *, frequencies=None,
background_levels=…, background_levels_ref=…, temperature=23.0,
static_pressure=101.325)` takes the same room levels plus the reference
source's levels and known power.

| Parameter | Type | Units | Range / default | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `levels_ref` | 1D or 2D array | dB | matches `levels` | Mean room SPL with the reference source (RSS) running |
| `lw_ref` | 1D array | dB | per band | Known sound power $L_W(\text{RSS})$ of the reference source |
| `background_levels` | 1D or 2D array | dB | matches `levels` | Background for the test source; per-band $K_1$ on $L_p(\text{ST})$ |
| `background_levels_ref` | 1D or 2D array | dB | matches `levels_ref` | Background for the **reference** source; per-band $K_1$ on $L_p(\text{RSS})$ |

`background_levels_ref` background-corrects the reference-source room level
$L_p(\text{RSS})$ exactly as `background_levels` does for the test source;
both need `frequencies` (the ISO 3741 criterion is frequency-dependent). Both
return a
`ReverberationSoundPowerResult`
(`sound_power_level`, `mean_pressure_level`, `absorption_area`,
`waterhouse_correction`, `background_correction`, `c1`, `c2`,
`speed_of_sound`, `sound_power_level_a`, `method`; the absorption/Waterhouse/`c1`
fields are `NaN` for the comparison method).

## 2. The measurement report (`.report()`)

The reverberation-room result (`ReverberationSoundPowerResult`, ISO 3741)
writes a one-page PDF fiche laid out like a sound-power test sheet through
its own `.report()`, sharing the layout and the `ReportMetadata` container of
the [pressure-method fiche](sound-power-pressure.md#3-the-measurement-report-report).
The standard-basis line
names ISO 3741:2010 and the precision accuracy grade (grade 1) and states which
method was used, the direct method using the room equivalent absorption area
(Eq. 20) or the comparison method using a reference sound source (Eq. 21). The
per-band table lists the mean room sound-pressure level $L_p$ and the band
sound-power level $L_W$, and the boxed $L_{W\mathrm{A}}$ carries the total $L_W$ and the
determination method (the reverberation result has no expanded uncertainty $U$).
`verbose=True` adds the background correction $K_1$ and, for the direct method,
the equivalent absorption area $A$ and the Waterhouse boundary correction $C_\mathrm{w}$;
the basis strip states the correction model (Eq. 20 or Eq. 21), the applied
meteorological corrections $C_1$/$C_2$ and the speed of sound, and cites the
Annex F A-weighting.

```python
import numpy as np
from phonometry import ReportMetadata, emission

freqs = np.array([125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000], float)
# Octave-band mean room sound-pressure levels in a qualified
# reverberation room of V = 200 m3, S = 240 m2, with a uniform T60 = 2.0 s.
lp = np.array([80.0, 83.0, 85.0, 84.0, 80.0, 75.0, 68.0])
res = emission.sound_power_reverberation(
    lp, 2.0, volume=200.0, surface_area=240.0, frequencies=freqs,
    temperature=20.0, static_pressure=101.325,
)

res.report(
    "sound_power_reverberation.pdf",
    metadata=ReportMetadata(
        client="Example manufacturing plant",
        specimen="Hydraulic power pack (floor-standing)",
        test_room="Qualified reverberation room, V = 200 m3, T60 = 2.0 s",
        instrumentation="Class 1 sound level meter (IEC 61672-1), s/n 0042",
        laboratory="Phonometry reference example",
        report_id="EXAMPLE-3741",
        requirement=96.0,
    ),
)   # LWA = 94.3 dB(A) re 1 pW -> declared limit 96 dB(A): PASS
```

One caveat on that example: it runs Eq. 20 on **octave** bands for
compactness, and that is not a conforming ISO 3741 determination. Both
methods are defined on one-third-octave bands, and octave-band results are
formed afterwards by summing the one-third-octave band powers per Annex F
(Eq. F.1) — a summation not implemented here, so it has to be done by hand —
not by feeding octave levels into Eq. 20, whose Waterhouse and absorption
terms would then be evaluated at the octave mid-frequency instead of at each
third. Section 1's example, 100 Hz to 10 kHz in thirds, is the conforming
shape.

## 3. Sound energy level of a single event (clause 9.2)

Both methods above report a rate of energy flow, so a machine that fires once
and falls silent has no $L_W$ to determine. Clause 9.2 gives it the **sound
energy level** $L_J = 10\log_{10}(J/J_0)$, $J_0 = 1$ pJ (clause 3.18), by the
same two routes with the single event time-integrated sound pressure level
$L_E$ (clause 3.4) in place of $L_p$: Eq. 30 is Eq. 20 with
$\overline{L_E(\text{ST})}$ where $\overline{L_p(\text{ST})}$ stood, and Eq. 31
is Eq. 21 likewise,

$$
L_J = \overline{L_E(\text{ST})} + \left[10\log_{10}\frac{A}{A_0} + 4.34\ \frac{A}{S}
+ 10\log_{10}\left(1 + \frac{S c}{8 V f}\right) + C_1 + C_2 - 6\right], \qquad
L_J = L_W(\text{RSS}) + \left(\overline{L_E(\text{ST})} - \overline{L_p(\text{RSS})}\right) + C_2 .
$$

The measurement is clause 8.5: at least five events at each position, one at a
time or as one reading encompassing them all, through an interval that contains
the whole event including its decay, and no moving microphone for a
non-repetitive impulse. Clause 9.2.1 reduces both readings to the level of one
event (Eq. 22, the energy mean of $N_\mathrm{e}$ readings, or Eq. 23, one
reading less $10\log_{10} N_\mathrm{e}$), clause 9.2.2 corrects each position
for its own background by the frequency-dependent criterion of 9.1.2
(Eq. 25/26), and clause 9.2.3 energy-averages the corrected positions
(Eq. 27). The background is the time-averaged level measured over the same
integration time $T$ as the events, compared as its exposure over that window,
$L_{pi(\mathrm{B})} + 10\log_{10}(T/T_0)$, so that the energies Eq. 25
subtracts share one reference; `integration_time` is therefore required with
`background_levels` (the [errata registry](../../ERRATA.md) records the
reading). Annex F then forms the octave-band levels (Eq. F.4, the energy sum of
the three thirds of Table F.1 per octave, `octave_band_levels`) and the
A-weighted total (Eq. F.5, `sound_energy_level_a`).

`sound_energy_reverberation` takes the room arguments of
`sound_power_reverberation` and `sound_energy_comparison` the reference-source
arguments of `sound_power_comparison`, both plus `events`, `background_levels`
with `integration_time`; they return a `ReverberationSoundEnergyResult`
(`sound_energy_level`, `mean_event_level`, `absorption_area`,
`waterhouse_correction`, `background_correction`, `c1`, `c2`,
`speed_of_sound`, `sound_energy_level_a`, `method`, `events`,
`integration_time`) with `.plot()`, the same `NaN` fields for the comparison
method as its sound power twin, and the same qualification warnings. The
single event results carry no `.report()` fiche, and the averaging over several
source positions of Eq. 24 is left to the caller.
