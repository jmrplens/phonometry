description: "The two standard indices of speech intelligibility and the different questions they answer: the STI of IEC 60268-16, which rates a transmission channel, and the SII of ANSI S3.5, which rates a listening condition."
---

Both pages in this section reduce speech intelligibility to a number in
[0, 1], and the art is knowing which number answers your question. The
**Speech Transmission Index** (STI) rates a *transmission channel*: a room, a
public-address system, an intercom. The **Speech Intelligibility Index** (SII)
rates a *listening condition*: this speech spectrum, in this noise, heard by
this listener. A reverberant lecture hall is an STI problem; a hearing-aid
fitting or a cockpit warning heard over engine noise is an SII problem.

The physical difference sits in what each index models. STI
(**IEC 60268-16**) works on the speech *envelope*: intelligibility degrades
when reverberation and noise flatten the slow intensity modulations of speech,
and the index measures how much of that modulation survives the channel, via
the modulation transfer function. It can be computed indirectly from a
measured impulse response or measured directly with the STIPA test signal.
[Speech Transmission Index (STI)](/phonometry/guides/speech-transmission/)
covers the modulation physics, both methods and the Annex F rating bands.

SII (**ANSI S3.5-1997**) works on *audibility*: intelligibility is predicted
from how much of the speech-bearing spectrum rises above the listener's
effective threshold, band by band, weighted by each band's importance to
speech. Noise, self-masking, upward spread of masking and the listener's own
hearing threshold all enter explicitly, which is why SII extends naturally to
hearing loss.
[Speech Intelligibility Index](/phonometry/guides/speech-intelligibility/)
covers the one-third-octave-band method, including the standard speech spectra
for normal to shouted vocal effort.

The two connect back to the rest of the library naturally: the STI consumes
the impulse responses of
[Room Acoustics](/phonometry/guides/room-acoustics/), and the SII consumes the
hearing thresholds quantified in
[Hearing threshold](/phonometry/guides/hearing-threshold/).
