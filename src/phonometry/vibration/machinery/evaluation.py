r"""Evaluation of machine vibration by measurement (ISO 20816-1:2016).

Condition monitoring answers two questions, and they are not the same one.
:mod:`~phonometry.vibration.machinery.diagnostics` answers *where a fault
would show*, by turning the geometry of a bearing or a gear pair into the
frequencies it excites. This module answers the prior question a plant
actually asks: **is this machine acceptable at all**, from one broad-band
magnitude measured at a bearing.

ISO 20816-1 is the basis document of the series, merging what used to be
ISO 10816-1 and ISO 7919-1. It fixes the shape of the answer and leaves the
numbers to the machine-specific parts.

**Four evaluation zones** (6.3.2.3) grade a machine rather than pass or fail
it. Zone **A** is where newly commissioned machines normally fall; zone **B**
is acceptable for unrestricted long-term operation; zone **C** is
unsatisfactory for long-term continuous running, though the machine may run a
limited period until remedial action can be arranged; zone **D** is severe
enough to cause damage. Three boundaries separate them, and
:func:`evaluation_zone` is the comparison itself, blind to the quantity: the
specific parts set boundaries on shaft displacement, housing velocity or
housing acceleration, and the grading is the same in all three.

**Criterion I** (6.3.2) is that comparison applied to the vibration severity,
the largest broad-band magnitude measured at any bearing at rated speed.
Velocity carries it over a wide speed range, but a single velocity limit
regardless of frequency allows unacceptable displacement at low frequency and
unacceptable acceleration at high frequency. So the criterion is a curve, flat
between two corner frequencies and sloped outside them
(Figure 9, Formula (C.1)):

.. math::

   v_\mathrm{rms} = v_A \, Z_\mathrm{bound}
   \left(\frac{f_z}{f_x}\right)^{k}
   \left(\frac{f_y}{f_w}\right)^{m} \tag{C.1}

with :math:`f_z = f` below the lower corner :math:`f_x` and :math:`f_x` above
it, and :math:`f_w = f` above the upper corner :math:`f_y` and :math:`f_y`
below it, so both bracketed factors are unity between the corners.
:math:`Z_\mathrm{bound}` moves the one curve onto the three boundaries, and
Annex C.2 prints the factors it takes: 1 for the limit of zone A, **2,56** for
zone B and **6,4** for zone C.

**Criterion II** (6.3.3) judges a *change* from an established baseline, and a
change is a vector. Annex D makes the point with a machine whose magnitude
fell from 3 mm/s to 2,5 mm/s while its phase swung from 40° to 180°: the
magnitude moved by half a millimetre per second, and the vibration itself
moved by **5,2 mm/s**, ten times as much. :func:`vibration_vector_change` is
that subtraction.

Where no part of the series covers a machine and no experience is available,
Annex C.1 offers Table C.1: a ladder of preferred magnitudes and the range
each boundary is typically drawn from, with small machines at the low end and
large flexibly supported ones at the high end. They are a starting point for
agreement between supplier and customer, not an acceptance specification.
