r"""Sound power radiated into a duct by a fan, in-duct method: ISO 5136:2003.

A ducted fan does not radiate into a room: what leaves it travels down the
duct, so ISO 5136 measures it *inside* the duct. The fan is connected to an
anechoically terminated test duct on its inlet and/or outlet side, and a
microphone in that duct samples the one-third-octave sound pressure level at
three circumferential positions (clause 6.2.2), by multiplexing, or over one
continuous revolution (clauses 7.2.3 and 7.2.4). Three things stand between
that reading and the sound power. The microphone sits in a mean flow that
adds turbulent pressure fluctuations, so it is shielded by a sampling tube,
a nose cone or a foam ball; the shield has a frequency response of its own;
and above the first cut-on the duct carries higher-order modes to which a
sampling tube does not respond as it does to a plane wave. Clause 8 gathers
the three into one combined correction :math:`C` on the averaged level
(equations (9), (10) and (11)):

.. math::

   \overline{L_p} = 10 \lg\!\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} 10^{0.1 L_{pi}}\right]
   \mathrm{dB} + C, \qquad C = C_1 + C_2 + C_{3,4}
   \tag{Eqs 9, 10}

where :math:`C_1` is the microphone free-field correction from the
manufacturer's data, :math:`C_2` the frequency response correction of the
shield measured per clause 5.3.3.2 c) or 5.3.4.2, and :math:`C_{3,4}` the
combined mean flow velocity and modal correction. For a level already averaged
by multiplexing or a traverse, :math:`\overline{L_p} = \overline{L_{pm}} + C`
(equation (11)). The sound power then follows from the plane-wave relation of
clause 8.2:

.. math::

   L_W = \overline{L_p} + \left(10 \lg\frac{S}{S_0}
   - 10 \lg\frac{\rho c}{(\rho c)_0}\right) \mathrm{dB},
   \qquad S = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}, \quad S_0 = 1~\mathrm{m^2},
   \quad (\rho c)_0 = 400~\mathrm{N \cdot s/m^3}
   \tag{Eq. 12}

:math:`C_{3,4}` is the part of the standard that is not arithmetic. For the
sampling tube it is a polynomial in the mean flow velocity :math:`U`, in
metres per second, negative on the inlet side and positive on the outlet side
(clause 5.3.3.4, equation (7)):

.. math::

   C_{3,4} = \sum_{i=0}^{10} a_i U^i \tag{Eq. 7}

whose coefficients :math:`a_i` Annex A tabulates per one-third-octave band
and per range of test-duct diameter (Tables A.1 to A.6, 0,15 m to 2 m), an
empty cell being zero. The coefficients are normative for 50 Hz to 10 kHz and
:math:`|U| \le 40` m/s. The footnote of every table then adds two informative
extensions which do not combine: within 50 Hz to 10 kHz the rows also hold for
:math:`40 < |U| \le 60` m/s, while the rows for 12,5 kHz to 20 kHz are given
for :math:`|U| \le 40` m/s only, and carry their own ":math:`|U| \le 40` m/s"
band header in the print. A velocity beyond 40 m/s is therefore refused as
soon as a band above 10 kHz is asked for. For the omni-directional nose cone
and foam ball no modal data exist, and clause 5.3.4.3 replaces the polynomial
by the frequency-independent convective term (equation (8)):

.. math::

   C_{3,4} = 10 \lg \frac{1}{(1 - U/c)^2}~\mathrm{dB} \tag{Eq. 8}

with :math:`c` the speed of sound, which clause 5.3.4.3 prints as 340 m/s
"under normal conditions". A whole determination knows the duct air, so
:func:`sound_power_in_duct` evaluates Eq. (8) with the :math:`c` its
``temperature`` gives, the "speed of sound in the test duct" of Table 1;
the 340 m/s is the default of :func:`flow_modal_correction` called on its own.

The A-weighted sound power level is the energy sum of the band levels with the
:math:`C_j` of Table C.1 (Annex C, equation (C.1)), and the uncertainty to
be recorded is the reproducibility of Table 2, :math:`\sigma_R` per band for
the sampling tube, expanded to :math:`2\sigma_R` at 95 % coverage (clause 9.2).
Above 10 kHz the standard suggests the extrapolated values of Table 3 without
making them part of itself.

What is *not* a term of :math:`L_W`, and is therefore not computed here, is
the qualification of the facility and the instrument: the reflection
coefficient of the anechoic termination (Table 5, Annex F), the directivity
of the sampling tube (equation (6), Table 6), the signal-to-noise ratio
against turbulence (Annex B) and the duct geometry (clause 5.2). The
informative Annexes H and I extend the coefficient tables below 0,15 m and
above 2 m; the standard's own scope stops at those diameters and so does this
module.

class InDuctSoundPowerResult:
    r"""Result of an ISO 5136:2003 in-duct sound power determination.

    ``sound_power_level`` is the per-band :math:`L_W` of Eq. (12), and
    ``sound_power_level_a`` the A-weighted total of Annex C, Eq. (C.1), over
    the bands supplied. ``mean_pressure_level`` is the spatially averaged
    level before any correction, the bracket of Eq. (9) or the
    :math:`\overline{L_{pm}}` of Eq. (11); ``corrected_pressure_level`` is
    :math:`\overline{L_p}` after the combined correction. The three corrections
    are kept apart so the record clause 9.1 f) asks for can be made:
    ``microphone_correction`` (:math:`C_1`), ``shield_correction``
    (:math:`C_2`) and ``flow_modal_correction`` (:math:`C_{3,4}`), with
    ``combined_correction`` their sum (Eq. 10).

    ``reproducibility_standard_deviation`` is :math:`\sigma_R` of Table 2 per
    band (Table 3 above 10 kHz) and ``expanded_uncertainty`` is twice it, the
    95 % figure clause 9.2 says to record. ``information_only_band`` marks the
    bands the standard gives for information rather than as part of itself:
    those above 10 kHz, and every band when the sampling tube is used between
    40 m/s and 60 m/s (5.3.3.4 NOTE, clause 4). Table 2 is stated for the
    sampling tube; clause 4 NOTE 5 expects the figures to grow for the other
    shields and gives no others, so the same values are reported for them.

    ``duct_diameter`` and ``duct_area`` are :math:`d` and :math:`S`,
    ``characteristic_impedance`` is the :math:`\rho c` of the duct air and
    ``speed_of_sound`` its :math:`c`, ``flow_velocity`` is the signed :math:`U`
    (negative on the inlet side) and ``shield`` names the microphone shield.
