"""Resolving an ``(x, fs)`` argument pair that may arrive as a ``Signal``.

A function that consumes a recording should take a
:class:`phonometry.io.Signal` in place of the bare ``(x, fs)`` pair: the
object read from a measurement file already knows its sample rate and,
when calibrated, its digital-to-pascal factor, so asking the caller to
repeat either is asking for a transcription error. The helpers here are
that contract, in one place, so that the surfaces adopting it cannot
drift apart. Every function in the library that consumes a recording is
on it.

They live beside :class:`Signal` rather than in ``_internal`` because that
tree is a leaf every package may import: a resolver there would have to
import ``phonometry.io``, and importing a submodule runs its package
``__init__``, so ``_internal`` would sit at the wrong end of an import
cycle the moment ``io`` reached back for a toolbox helper.

The rules, identical everywhere:

- **Sample rate.** A :class:`~phonometry.io.Signal` brings its own; an
  explicit one that disagrees is refused rather than arbitrated, because
  the rate is a fact of the recording and silently trusting either side
  mis-times every filter downstream. A bare array knows nothing about
  time, so there the argument stays mandatory -- except where the rate is
  only a label for the result's time axis and the computation never reads
  it, which is :func:`resolve_optional_fs` and stays callable without
  one.
- **Samples.** What is not a signal is refused here, by the name the
  entry point gave it, and as a ``ValueError`` because that is what the
  entry points document: ``None``, a string, a dict, a ragged list of
  lists, and a ``NaN`` or an infinity among the samples. The last of
  those is a refusal rather than a passing-on because a single
  non-finite sample survives every filter and poisons every band
  computed from it, so a call that lost one sample comes back with a
  whole spectrum of ``NaN`` and nothing said. See
  :func:`phonometry._internal.utils._typesignal`, which is where all of
  it happens.
- **Calibration.** A calibrated Signal presents its samples in pascals.
  One rule rather than a per-function taxonomy: it is what keeps every
  surface on this contract talking about the same signal, instead of one
  reading pascals and its neighbour digital units. What that buys
  depends on what the call returns -- a waveform in pascals, a squared
  envelope in Pa2, a level in dB SPL re 20 uPa -- but the samples that
  enter the computation are the same either way. Bare arrays are
  untouched: they are taken to be in whatever unit they always were.
- **Exemptions**, taken with ``calibrate=False``, each said out loud in
  the docstring of the surface that takes it. Anything referenced to
  digital full scale rather than to 20 uPa (a ``dbfs=True`` path, and
  the EBU R 128 / ITU-R BS.1770 loudness family when it adopts this
  contract) must not see pascals, or it reports ``20*log10(factor)``
  of offset under a full-scale name. Neither must a function that
  *derives* the factor from a calibrator take, nor one whose quantity is
  not a pressure at all (acceleration in m/s2, force in N).
