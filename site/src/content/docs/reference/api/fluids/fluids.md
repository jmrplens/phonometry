fluids domain of phonometry (see module docstrings).

The state of the medium a sound travels through, computed from the conditions
that were measured rather than assumed. Every other package may import this one
without an architecture edge, the way they import `phonometry.filters`,
`phonometry.signals` and `phonometry.metrology`: a medium is not a
domain of application but something every domain needs, and eleven identical
edges would record nothing.

What lives here is the *physics* of a fluid. A simplified formula a measurement
standard prints inside its own procedure stays in that standard's module, where
its clause can be cited beside it, and a constant frozen by a conformance row
never moves at all. Those three are different things, and keeping them apart is
what lets better physics reach a caller without any measurement silently
ceasing to reproduce the standard it claims.

## Fluid

```python
Fluid(
    temperature_c: float,
    static_pressure_pa: float,
    composition: Mapping[str, float],
    model: str,
    validity: str,
    properties: Mapping[str, float],
)
```

One fluid at one state, and the properties its model fixed there.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `temperature_c` | Temperature, in degrees Celsius. |
| `static_pressure_pa` | Absolute static pressure, in pascals. |
| `composition` | What distinguishes this fluid from another at the same temperature and pressure: the relative humidity of air, the salinity and depth of sea water. Read it to know what was assumed. |
| `model` | The model that produced the properties, named so a result can cite it. |
| `validity` | The domain the model states for itself, in words, or the empty string where it states none. Prose, because sources state these in prose and reducing them to a box loses the conditions attached to them. |
| `properties` | The quantities the model determined, in SI. Reached through the named accessors, which raise [`FluidPropertyUnavailable`](/phonometry/reference/api/fluids/fluids/#fluidpropertyunavailable) for a quantity that is absent. |

### Fluid.characteristic_impedance

*property*

`rho c`, in pascal seconds per metre.

Closed by identity from two quantities the model fixed, so it is
available whenever both of those are.

### Fluid.density

*property*

Density `rho`, in kilograms per cubic metre.

### Fluid.heat_capacity_ratio

*property*

Ratio of specific heats `kappa` (`gamma`), dimensionless.

### Fluid.kinematic_viscosity

*property*

`nu = eta / rho`, in square metres per second.

### Fluid.prandtl_number

*property*

`Pr = eta / (rho alpha_t)`, dimensionless.

A model that prints its own Prandtl number keeps it: a published fit
carries the value it was fitted with, and closing the identity from a
better air would silently change the model rather than correct it. A
model that does not print one has it closed from the three that it did.

### Fluid.specific_heat_capacity

*property*

Specific heat capacity at constant pressure `C_P`, in J/(kg K).

### Fluid.speed_of_sound

*property*

Speed of sound `c`, in metres per second.

### Fluid.thermal_conductivity

*property*

Thermal conductivity `k_a`, in watts per metre kelvin.

### Fluid.thermal_diffusivity

*property*

Thermal diffusivity `alpha_t`, in square metres per second.

### Fluid.viscosity

*property*

Dynamic viscosity `eta`, in pascal seconds.

## FluidAssumptionWarning

A fluid was built from a default the caller did not supply.

The default is a documented value, not a measurement of the caller's air or
water, so it is announced. Passing every argument silences it. Python shows
a warning once per call site by default, and
`warnings.filterwarnings("error", category=FluidAssumptionWarning)` turns
it into a hard failure for anyone who wants one.

## FluidPropertyUnavailable

A quantity the model that built this fluid does not determine.

## FluidWarning

A fluid state outside the domain its model states for itself.
