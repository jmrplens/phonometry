"""The committed conformance indicators say what the artefact says.

Six SVGs under ``.github/badges`` are generated and committed, so the same
three properties the artefact itself has to hold apply here: they must be a
function of the tree alone, they must carry the tree's own numbers rather than
a figure typed in beside them, and the documents that point at them must point
at files that exist.

The guards below are the ones that would otherwise fail somewhere far away. A
non-deterministic byte fails as a red ``conformance`` job on an unrelated pull
request. A hard-coded count fails as a banner that says 566 for ever. A renamed
badge fails as a broken image in a rendered document and nowhere else, because
the old file is still tracked, still unchanged, and still green. And a colour
chosen for one theme fails only for the half of the readership in the other,
which is why the contrast is measured here and not asserted in a comment.
