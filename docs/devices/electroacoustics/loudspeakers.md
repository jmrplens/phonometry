# Loudspeaker Characterisation (IEC 60268-5)

A loudspeaker datasheet is a bundle of conventions, and IEC 60268-5 is the
standard that fixes them: what "sensitivity" refers to, over which band a
frequency range is read, how directivity is plotted and at what drive the
distortion is measured. This guide covers the chain phonometry implements
around a measured on-axis response: the **sensitivity conventions** where
cross-datasheet comparisons usually go wrong, the baffled **radiating
piston** that is the canonical physical model behind a cone's radiation
impedance and directivity, and the **rated-characteristics report** that
renders the standard's data sheet, with every panel drawn to the IEC 60263
scale conventions. The distortion and frequency-response measurements that
feed it live in [Electroacoustics](electroacoustics.md); the microphone
counterpart has [its own guide](microphones.md).

## 1. Sensitivity conventions (IEC 60268-5)

Distortion and response figures only compare across devices when the
*sensitivity* conventions behind them match, and two conventions trip people
constantly: the microphone reference level and the loudspeaker
power-and-distance normalization.

**Loudspeakers (IEC 60268-5 clause 20.3).** The characteristic sensitivity is
the sound pressure produced at 1 m on the reference axis, in the free field,
referred to an input of 1 W into the rated impedance; expressed as a level re
20 µPa (clause 20.4) it is the familiar "dB @ 1 W/1 m". Two normalizations
hide in that sentence:

- *The electrical one.* The test voltage is $U_p = \sqrt{R \cdot 1\,\text{W}}$,
  numerically $\sqrt{R}$: 2.83 V into a rated 8 Ω. A datasheet quoting "dB @ 2.83 V/1 m" for a
  4 Ω loudspeaker is feeding it 2 W, which flatters the figure by 3 dB
  against a true 1 W/1 m rating; check the rated impedance before comparing.
- *The geometric one.* 1 m is a **reference** distance, not necessarily the
  measurement distance. The standard has you measure in the far field (at
  0.5 m or an integer number of metres, clause 7.1) and refer the result back
  with the inverse-distance law,
  $L_p(1\ \text{m}) = L_p(r) + 20\log_{10}(r / 1\ \text{m})$. That
  scaling only holds where the level actually falls 6 dB per doubling of
  distance, hence the free field of the diagram; at 1 m from a large
  multi-way cabinet the near field may not have ended yet, and the quoted
  "1 m" figure is then a referred quantity, not what a microphone placed at
  1 m would read.

The microphone counterpart, the sensitivity level re 1 V/Pa and its
reference-value pitfall, is covered in
[Microphone Characterisation (IEC 60268-4)](microphones.md).

## 2. Radiating piston: radiation impedance and directivity

The rigid circular **piston in an infinite baffle** is the canonical radiator
behind a loudspeaker cone, the open end of a duct and the radiation efficiency
of any finite vibrating surface (Beranek & Mellow §4.19, §13.7). Its mechanical
radiation impedance is $Z_r = \rho c S\,(R_1 + jX_1)$ with $S = \pi a^2$ and the
dimensionless resistance and reactance functions (Eqs. (13.117), (13.118))

$$
R_1(x) = 1 - \frac{2 J_1(x)}{x}, \qquad X_1(x) = \frac{2 H_1(x)}{x},
\qquad x = 2ka,
$$

with $J_1$ the Bessel function and $H_1$ the Struve function of order one. At
low frequency $R_1 \to (ka)^2/2$ and the reactance is mass-like with the
radiation mass $M_r = 8\rho a^3/3$ (Eq. (4.151)); at high frequency
$R_1 \to 1$, $X_1 \to 0$ and the piston radiates as into an infinite tube. The
far field follows the directivity
$D(\theta) = 2 J_1(ka\sin\theta)/(ka\sin\theta)$, whose first null is at
$ka\sin\theta = 3.8317$.

```python
import numpy as np
from phonometry import radiating_piston

res = radiating_piston(radius=0.1, frequencies=np.geomspace(20, 20000, 200),
                       angles=np.linspace(0.0, np.pi / 2, 91))
print(round(res.radiation_mass, 4))               # 8 rho a^3 / 3, kg
print(round(float(res.directivity_index[0]), 2))  # 3.01 dB half-space limit
res.plot()                                         # R1 and X1 vs ka
```

<picture><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmrplens/phonometry/main/.github/images/piston_radiation_impedance_dark.svg"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmrplens/phonometry/main/.github/images/piston_radiation_impedance.svg" alt="Normalized radiation resistance R1 and reactance X1 of a 75 mm baffled circular piston against ka on a logarithmic axis: R1 rises from ka squared over two through unity with decaying ripples, while the mass-like X1 peaks near ka of 1.4 and decays, with the high-frequency limit R1 equal to 1 marked" width="82%"></picture>

*The `.plot()` of the result is the classic Beranek & Mellow impedance figure
computed for this piston: below $ka \approx 1$ the load is almost purely
mass-like ($X_1$ dominates and $R_1 \propto (ka)^2$, the regime where a
loudspeaker's output is stiffness- and mass-limited), and above it the
resistance settles on $\rho c S$ with interference ripples while the
reactance dies away.*

`radiating_piston` returns a `RadiatingPistonResult` with the normalized
`resistance`/`reactance`, the mechanical `radiation_resistance`/`radiation_reactance`,
the `radiation_mass`, the `directivity_index`, the far-field `directivity`
pattern (when `angles` are given) and `.plot()`. The building blocks
`piston_resistance`, `piston_reactance` and `piston_directivity` are also
callable directly. The piston is the companion radiator of the
[reactive silencers](../noise-control/silencers.md).

The far-field **directivity pattern** is a plottable result in its own right:
`piston_directivity_pattern(ka)` samples $D(\theta)$ at one or more $ka$ values
and returns a `PistonDirectivity` (the polar angle grid, the linear `directivity`
and its dB form `directivity_db`, and the `ka` values) whose `.plot()` draws the
classic polar beam pattern. Several $ka$ are shown as one family, so the main
lobe narrowing and the side lobes appearing read at a glance:

```python
from phonometry import piston_directivity_pattern

pattern = piston_directivity_pattern([3.0, 8.0, 16.0])
print(pattern.directivity_db.shape)  # (3, 361): one row per ka
pattern.plot()                       # polar beam pattern in dB (needs matplotlib)
```

Behind both curves sits the same physical object, and `.plot_geometry()` on
the piston result draws it: the plate in its rigid baffle to scale, with the
far-field lobe of the highest computed frequency overlaid on the radiation
side.

*The piston the impedance and directivity curves describe, to scale: at
4 kHz this 10 cm radius plate has $ka \approx 7.3$, so the overlaid lobe is

## 3. Loudspeaker characteristics report (IEC 60268-5)

The rated characteristics IEC 60268-5 defines around a measured on-axis
response gather into a single **loudspeaker characteristics** result that
renders the standard's rated-characteristics data sheet. Two of the numbers are
computed from the response rather than merely repeated:

- **Characteristic sensitivity level** (20.3/20.4). The on-axis level averaged
  over a stated band, referred to 1 W into the rated impedance $R$ at 1 m:
  $L_M = \overline{L} + 20\log_{10}(d/d_0) + 20\log_{10}(U_p/U)$ with
  $U_p = \sqrt{R\cdot 1\,\text{W}} = \sqrt R$.
  The default drive is that $\sqrt R$ (2.83 V into 8 Ω), so with a 1 m response
  the sensitivity level is the band mean.
- **Effective frequency range** (21.2). The band over which the response stays
  within 10 dB of the level averaged over the one-octave band in the region of
  maximum sensitivity; troughs narrower than 1/9 octave are neglected.

```python
import numpy as np
from phonometry import (
    LoudspeakerDirectivity, ReportMetadata, loudspeaker_characteristics,
    radiating_piston,
)

freqs = np.geomspace(30, 24000, 320)
spl = 87.0 + 1.2 * np.sin(2 * np.log2(freqs / 900.0))
spl -= 10 * np.log10(1 + (50.0 / freqs) ** 6)       # low-frequency roll-off
spl -= 10 * np.log10(1 + (freqs / 16000.0) ** 7)    # high-frequency roll-off

result = loudspeaker_characteristics(
    freqs, spl, rated_impedance=8.0, sensitivity_band=(200.0, 4000.0),
    impedance=(np.geomspace(20, 20000, 260),
               6.6 + 24 * np.exp(-(np.log2(np.geomspace(20, 20000, 260) / 52.0) ** 2) / 0.12)),
    distortion=(np.geomspace(50, 5000, 140),
                0.3 + 2.6 * np.exp(-(np.log2(np.geomspace(50, 5000, 140) / 70.0) ** 2) / 0.45)),
    directivity=LoudspeakerDirectivity(
        piston=radiating_piston(0.075, np.array([1000.0, 2000.0, 4000.0]),
                                angles=np.radians(np.linspace(0, 90, 46))),
        frequency=2000.0,
    ),
)
print(round(result.sensitivity_level_db, 1))                 # dB, 1 W / 1 m
print(tuple(round(x) for x in result.effective_range))       # Hz

result.report("loudspeaker.pdf", metadata=ReportMetadata(measurement_standard="IEC 60268-5"))
```

`loudspeaker_characteristics` returns a `LoudspeakerCharacteristics` with the
computed `sensitivity_level_db`, `effective_range`, `reference_level_db`,
`characteristic_sensitivity_pa` and `minimum_impedance`, and a `.report()` that
writes the fiche. The on-axis response is drawn with its tolerance band and the
effective-range markers to the IEC 60263 proportion (one frequency decade equal
to 25 dB), and the polar directivity on the IEC 60263 25 dB reference circle.
The impedance modulus (with the 80 %-of-rated line), the total-harmonic-distortion
curve and the directivity feed the secondary panels, reusing the radiating
piston directivity of section 2 and a
[swept-sine THD](swept-sine-distortion.md) result for the distortion curve.
None of the standard's measuring conditions is checked here: the functions
reduce and report the curves they are handed, so the mounting, the
excitation, the gate and the field condition are the operator's to keep and
to state with the result. Thiele-Small parameter extraction from the
impedance curve is not implemented either: the impedance panel reports the
measured modulus against the rated-impedance lines.

The rated characteristics are also available interactively through `.plot()`,
which draws **one concept per figure** with the same panel code the report
composes, selected by `quantity`. Passing an axes draws on it:

```python
result.plot()                        # on-axis response (default)
result.plot(quantity="impedance")    # |Z| modulus with the rated / 80 % lines
result.plot(quantity="thd")          # total harmonic distortion vs frequency
result.plot(quantity="directivity")  # polar response on the 25 dB circle
```

## 4. Gain before feedback of a reinforcement system

Everything above characterises a loudspeaker on its own. Put it in a room with
an open microphone and the interesting quantity is no longer a datasheet number
but a **closed loop**: the loudspeaker feeds the audience, and it also feeds the
microphone that drives it. Long (*Architectural Acoustics* 2e, Chapter 18,
Equations (18.13) to (18.24)) writes that loop with two decibel gains:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Z_S &= L_{H\text{-}L} - L_{T\text{-}M}
  && \text{(Eq. (18.17))  open-loop system gain} \\
G_S &= L_{H\text{-}M} - L_{H\text{-}L} + D_M(\theta)
  && \text{(Eq. (18.18))  feedback-loop gain}
\end{aligned}
$$

$Z_S$ is the level the loudspeaker produces at an average listener minus the
level the talker produces at the microphone; $Z_S = -6$ dB, typical of an
auditorium or a church, means a comfortable conversational level at twice the
talker-to-microphone distance. $D_M(\theta)$ is the directivity index of the
microphone toward the loudspeaker *relative to* the talker: zero for an
omnidirectional microphone, about −2 to −3 dB for a cardioid pointed at the
talker. Summing the infinite series of round trips, the system oscillates when
the loop gain reaches unity, that is $Z_S + G_S = 0$ (Equation (18.16)).

<picture><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmrplens/phonometry/main/.github/images/sound_reinforcement_geometry_dark.svg"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmrplens/phonometry/main/.github/images/sound_reinforcement_geometry.svg" alt="Schematic of a sound-reinforcement feedback loop: the talker 0.3 metres in front of the microphone, the flown loudspeaker 4 metres from the microphone and 12 metres from the average listener, with the signal path drawn solid and the feedback path dashed" width="85%"></picture>

*The four points of the loop. Only the sound field the loudspeaker produces at
two of them, and the type and orientation of the microphone, enter the
criterion: the loudspeaker's own type, number and power do not appear anywhere
in it.*

A working system needs margin below that threshold. Long takes **10 dB** for an
equalised system (other authors quote 12 dB unequalised and 6 dB carefully
equalised): 6 dB of it covers a sustained tone adding in phase with a reflection
off a hard surface, and the remaining 4 dB is safety. With several microphones
open at once the returned signals add at the mixer, which the
number-of-open-microphones correction $\Delta L_\text{nom} = 10\log_{10} N_m$
accounts for (Equation (18.23)). The criterion is then

$$
Z_S + L_{H\text{-}M} + \Delta L_\text{nom} \le L_{H\text{-}L} - D_M(\theta) - 10.
$$

```python
from phonometry import electroacoustics as ea

# An auditorium at Zs = -6 dB, omnidirectional microphone, one mic open.
res = ea.feedback_stability(-6.0, 76.0, 80.0)
print(res.is_stable, round(res.headroom, 1))          # True 0.0 dB
print(round(res.maximum_level_at_microphone, 1))      # 76.0 dB = L(H-L) - 4

# A cardioid buys back exactly its relative directivity index.
card = ea.feedback_stability(-6.0, 78.0, 80.0, microphone_directivity=-2.0)
print(round(card.maximum_level_at_microphone, 1))     # 78.0 dB = L(H-L) - 2

# Four open microphones cost 10 lg 4 = 6 dB of that headroom.
print(round(ea.open_microphone_correction(4), 1))     # 6.0 dB

res.plot()      # the gain structure against the oscillation and margin lines
```

Those two special cases are Long's own (Equations (18.21) and (18.22)): with
$Z_S = -6$ dB the criterion collapses to
$L_{H\text{-}M} \le L_{H\text{-}L} - D_M(\theta) - 4$, so an omnidirectional
microphone must see the loudspeaker 4 dB below the average level in the
audience, while a cardioid may let it rise to 2 dB below.

> **A sign slip in the printed equation.** Long prints Equation (18.24) with
> `+ D_M(theta)` on the right-hand side, which contradicts the Equations (18.20) to
> (18.22) it generalises and would turn the benefit of a directional microphone
> into a penalty. `feedback_stability` implements the sign of Equation (18.20),
> so that $N_m = 1$ reproduces Long's own special cases exactly. The defect is
> recorded in the [errata registry](../../ERRATA.md).

`nom_correction`, `loop_gain`, `margin`, `headroom`, `is_stable`,
`maximum_open_loop_gain`, `maximum_level_at_microphone`) with `.plot()`.
`feedback_loop_gain` and `open_microphone_correction` are callable directly, and
`plot_sound_reinforcement_geometry` draws the loop above.

The criterion is a level bookkeeping exercise, not an acoustic model: it
consumes the two direct-field levels the loudspeaker produces and does not
compute them from a coverage pattern, nor does it predict the ring frequency or
the effect of an equaliser or frequency shifter. Long excludes the reverberant
field deliberately, because a uniform field cannot depend on where the
microphone is or where it points; the direct-to-reverberant ratio enters the
design separately.

## Standards

IEC 60268-5:2003+A1:2007, *Sound system equipment – Part 5: Loudspeakers*:
the rated loudspeaker characteristics of section 3, namely the rated impedance
(16), the rated frequency range (19.1), the characteristic sensitivity and
its level referred to 1 W at 1 m (20.3/20.4), the effective frequency range
against the −10 dB band (21.2), the directivity index (23.3) and the total
harmonic distortion against frequency (24.1). IEC 60263:1982, *Scales and
sizes for plotting frequency characteristics and polar diagrams*: the scale
proportions of the characteristic graphs, one frequency decade equal to
25 dB on the ordinate (clause 2) and the polar diagram on a 25 dB
reference-circle radius (clause 3). The piston quantities are verified
against exact analytic oracles (the low- and high-frequency limits of the
radiation impedance and the half-space directivity index).
