Laboratory sound insulation of building elements (ISO 10140).

This is the **laboratory** counterpart of the field ISO 16283 family in
:mod:`phonometry.insulation`. In a qualified test facility flanking
transmission is suppressed, so the *direct* airborne sound reduction index
``R`` (not the apparent ``R'``) is the primary quantity, and the receiving
room's equivalent absorption area ``A`` is a property of the known facility.

**Airborne sound reduction index (ISO 10140-2:2010).** From the
energy-average sound pressure levels in the source room ``L1`` and receiving
room ``L2`` this module forms, per one-third-octave band,
``R = L1 - L2 + 10 lg(S/A)`` (Clause 3.1, Formula (2)) with the free test
opening area ``S`` and the Sabine equivalent absorption area
``A = 0,16 V / T`` (ISO 10140-4:2010, Clause 4.6.3, Formula (5)). The
single-number weighted rating ``Rw`` and the adaptation terms ``C`` / ``Ctr``
follow ISO 717-1 (Clause 5.3) through the verified
:func:`phonometry.weighted_rating` engine, reused unchanged.

**Impact sound pressure level (ISO 10140-3:2010).** With the standard
tapping machine exciting the floor under test this module forms, from the
energy-average impact sound pressure level ``Li`` in the receiving room, the
normalized impact sound pressure level ``Ln = Li + 10 lg(A/A0)`` (Clause 3.2,
Formula (1)) with ``A = 0,16 V / T`` and the reference absorption area
``A0 = 10 m²``. The single-number weighted rating ``Ln,w`` and the term
``CI`` follow ISO 717-2 (Clause 5.3) through
:func:`phonometry.weighted_impact_rating`, reused unchanged.

**Background-noise correction (ISO 10140-4:2010, Clause 4.3, Formula (4)).**
The receiving-room levels must be corrected for background noise before the
insulation is formed. :func:`background_correction` implements the correction
``L = 10 lg(10^(Lsb/10) - 10^(Lb/10))`` for a signal-to-background margin
between 6 dB and 15 dB, the fixed 1,3 dB correction (limit of measurement)
for a margin of 6 dB or less, and no correction for a margin of 15 dB or
more. The 6/15 dB criteria are the laboratory analogue of the 6/10 dB
criteria of ISO 16283-1 Clause 9.2; both cap the correction at 1,3 dB.

**Frequency range (ISO 10140-4:2010, Clause 4.1).** Quantities are measured
over the mandatory one-third-octave range 100 Hz to 5000 Hz (optionally down
to 50 Hz). The single-number rating uses the core 100 Hz to 3150 Hz (16
one-third-octave bands) / 125 Hz to 2000 Hz (5 octave bands) range of
ISO 717-1/2, so the automatic rating is formed only when exactly 16 or 5
per-band values are supplied.
