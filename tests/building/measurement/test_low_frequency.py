"""Tests for the ISO 16283 low-frequency procedure and its three consumers.

**There is no numeric oracle.** ISO 16283-1:2014, ISO 16283-2:2020 and
ISO 16283-3:2016 publish no worked example of this procedure: Annex B of Part 1
and Annex C of Part 2 are blank recording forms and the "Examples" of Annexes D
and E are loudspeaker-position drawings. What stands in for one, and is what
these tests hold the code to:

- **Exact printed numbers.** The trigger is "smaller than 25 m³ (calculated to
  the nearest cubic metre)" and the bands are 50 Hz, 63 Hz and 80 Hz. Both are
  characters on a page, so both are pinned exactly, including the boundary
  case where the tree's round-half-away-from-zero and Python's built-in
  round-half-to-even disagree.
- **Closed forms of Formula (13).** The combination degenerates to ``L`` when
  the corner level equals it, is strictly increasing in the corner level, and
  is bounded below by ``10 lg(2/3) + L``. Its value is also recomputed here
  from the printed expression on a hand case.
- **Formula (12) against its own two readings.** The energy mean over ``q``
  source positions reduces to the maximum over corners at ``q = 1``, and the
  maximum is taken per band, which is the NOTE under the formula.
- **The 63 Hz octave substitution against the tree's own reverberation
  machinery.** NOTE 1 of Clause 10.4 says one-third-octave decays below 100 Hz
  are prone to error for want of modes; run through
  :func:`phonometry.room.room_parameters`, the 63 Hz octave band recovers a
  known single-sloped decay measurably better than the three one-third-octave
  bands do, which is the reason the clause gives, measured rather than
  asserted.
- **One implementation, three parts.** The airborne, impact and facade entry
  points are shown to produce identical low-frequency records from identical
  inputs, which is the whole point of the shared helper.

Nothing here computes an expected value by calling the code under test.
