Rotorcraft noise by the hemisphere method (ECAC Doc 32 / NORAH2).

The ECAC Doc 32 rotorcraft-noise method describes a helicopter's highly directive
source with a **noise hemisphere**: one-third-octave-band sound pressure levels on
a spherical grid of azimuth ``φ`` and polar angle ``θ`` at a fixed 60 m reference
distance (at ICAO reference atmospheric conditions). Placing that source at a
receiver adds the propagation adjustment ``ΔLp = ΔLs + ΔLa + ΔLg (+ ΔLd)``
(spherical spreading, atmospheric absorption, ground effect and — later — shielding).

This module provides the source and propagation primitives and the single-event
method built on them (clean-room, from the NORAH2 guidance SC01.D1.5d, the basis
of ECAC Doc 32):

* :func:`hemisphere_source_level` -- the interpolated source level ``L(fc, φ, θ)``
  from a :class:`RotorcraftHemisphere`, bilinear over the 10° grid (Eq. 13) with
  nearest-bin fill outside the measured coverage (Eq. 14/15).
* :func:`spherical_spreading_adjustment` -- ``ΔLs = −20·log10(r/60)`` (Eq. 24).
* :func:`atmospheric_adjustment` -- ``ΔLa = −α(f)·(r−60)`` with the ISO 9613-1
  pure-tone coefficient (Eq. 26/27), reusing
  :func:`~phonometry.environmental.air_absorption.air_attenuation`.
* :func:`ground_effect_adjustment` -- ``ΔLg`` for a point source over an impedance
  plane (Chien-Soroka, Eq. 28-35) with the Delany-Bazley one-parameter impedance
  and the CNOSSOS flow-resistivity classes.
* :func:`flight_condition_weights` / :func:`interpolated_source_level` -- the
  flight-condition interpolation across a hemisphere set: distance-scaled
  triangulation inside the convex hull of the normalised ``(V̄, γ̄)`` database
  conditions, nearest neighbour outside (Eq. 3-10).
* :func:`flight_path_kinematics` -- track kinematics by central finite
  differences: ground speed, airspeed, heading, curvature, bank and path angle
  (Eq. 16-21 / Doc 32 Eq. 8-10).
* :func:`rotorcraft_event_level` -- the received one-third-octave time history of
  a single event at recorded time (Eq. 1/22/23) and its integrated metrics:
  ``LASmax``, ``SEL`` (Doc 32 Eq. 27) and ``EPNL`` (Doc 32 Eq. 28, ICAO Annex 16).
* :func:`rotorcraft_noise_contour` -- the single-event ``SEL``/``LASmax`` ground
  grid.

Source (clean-room): ECAC Doc 32, 1st ed.; NORAH2 rotorcraft-noise modelling
guidance (EASA.2020.FC.06 SC01.D1.5d), §A.3-A.5. The atmospheric term is validated
against the guidance Table 4 (one-third-octave attenuation per km at ICAO
reference conditions); the event chain is validated end to end against the NORAH2
reference implementation outputs for the ARP verification cases (angles, retarded
times, hemisphere selection, per-step levels and event metrics).

    evaluated at the exact band centre (Eq. 26/27, ICAO reference atmosphere by
    default). This matches the guidance Eq. 27 to 0.02 dB/km and the NORAH2
    reference implementation. The guidance's alternative per-band mapping (SAE
    method by Rickley et al., its Table 4) coincides below 3.15 kHz and deviates

    Bands below the 50 Hz floor of the ISO 9613-1 tabulation (the NORAH grid
    starts at 10 Hz) use the same analytic formulas; the advisory out-of-range
    warning is suppressed because ``α`` is negligible there (Table 4 lists
    0.0 dB/km for every band up to 50 Hz). The suppression only applies while
    every band stays within the 10 kHz top of the NORAH grid; above that the

    cancels in the distances ``δ_j`` (Eq. 7) either way. Inside the

    contributes with inverse-distance weights ``(1/δ_j)/Σ(1/δ_j)``,
    ``δ_j = √((γ̄−γ̄_j)² + (V̄−V̄_j)²)`` (Eq. 7/8); outside it (and whenever no
    triangulation exists, e.g. collinear conditions) the nearest database
    condition is adopted unblended (Eq. 9/10). A query on a database condition
    returns that hemisphere alone. ECAC Doc 32, 1st ed., §4.1 defines no
    interpolation ("select the most appropriate hemisphere"); this is the
    interpolation of the NORAH2 guidance §A.3.1 on which the NORAH database and
    reference implementation operate, and it degrades to the Doc 32 behaviour
    outside the measured envelope.

    The scaling is span-based, so the weights do not depend on the units of

    For every track point the flight condition selects (or blends, Eq. 3-10)
    the hemispheres, the emission angles address the source level (Eq. 13-15)
    and the propagation adjustment ``ΔLp = ΔLs + ΔLa + ΔLg`` (Eq. 23-35) places
    it at the receiver. The received one-third-octave history is expressed at
    recorded time ``t_r = t_e + r/c`` (Eq. 22) and integrated into ``LASmax``,
    ``SEL`` (Doc 32 Eq. 27) and ``EPNL`` (Doc 32 Eq. 28, ICAO Annex 16 App. 2,
    reusing
    :func:`~phonometry.aircraft.aircraft_noise.epnl_from_pnlt`).

    The flight condition per point comes from the ``airspeed``/``path_angle``
    overrides when given (e.g. the smoothed values of a radar-track workflow),
    otherwise from :func:`flight_path_kinematics` on the track itself, in which
    case the database ``airspeeds`` must be in m/s. The hemisphere frame is
    oriented by the heading and tilted by the bank angle in turns (guidance
    §A.3.4); pitch attitude is implicit in the hemispheres.

    :param hemispheres: The database hemispheres, one per flight condition.
    :param airspeeds: Database airspeeds ``V_j``, shape ``(J,)`` (same units as
        the ``airspeed`` values used for selection).
    :param path_angles: Database path angles ``γ_j``, in degrees, shape ``(J,)``.
    :param times: Track times, in s, strictly increasing, shape ``(N,)``.
    :param positions: Track positions ``(x, y, z)``, in metres, shape ``(N, 3)``
        (z up, above the ground elevation datum).
    :param receiver: Receiver ground position ``(x, y)``, in metres.
    :param receiver_height: Microphone height above local ground, in metres
        (default 1.2).
    :param ground_elevation: Ground elevation ``z`` at the site, in metres on
        the track datum (default 0); source and receiver heights above ground
        follow from it.
    :param airspeed: Per-point airspeed override, scalar or shape ``(N,)``.
    :param path_angle: Per-point path-angle override, in degrees.
    :param heading: Per-point heading override, in degrees.
    :param bank_angle: Per-point bank-angle override, in degrees (positive
        starboard down).
    :param flow_resistivity: Ground flow resistivity ``σ`` in Pa·s/m², or a
        CNOSSOS class letter (see :func:`ground_effect_adjustment`).
    :param temperature: Air temperature, in °C (default 25, ICAO reference).
    :param relative_humidity: Relative humidity, in % (default 70).
    :param pressure: Ambient pressure, in kPa (default 101.325).
    :param level_offset: Source-level offset ``ΔEPNL`` added to the hemisphere
        levels (Eq. 2 class substitution), in dB (default 0). Scalar or per
        track point, shape ``(N,)``: Chapter-8 substitutions correct climb,
        level and descent conditions with different certification levels.
    :param scaling_factor: Flight-condition scaling factor ``F_fc`` (default 2).
    :param triangles: Optional precomputed flight-condition triangulation (see
        :func:`flight_condition_weights`).
    :param atmospheric_method: ``"iso9613"`` for the pure-tone Eq. 26/27 term
        (the guidance text), or ``"sae"`` for the SAE ARP 5534 band-integrated
        mapping used by the NORAH2 reference implementation (they agree to
        ~0.05 dB below 3.15 kHz).
    :param terrain: Optional digital elevation model ``(x, y, z)`` on the
        track frame (``x`` and ``y`` strictly increasing, ``z`` of shape
        ``(len(y), len(x))``, all in metres on the track datum). When given,
        every emission-receiver pair is evaluated over its sampled vertical
        section (guidance §A.4.4/A.4.5): mean-ground-plane ground effect with
        equivalent heights, and rubber-band diffraction where terrain blocks
        the line of sight; ``ground_elevation`` is then taken from the model.
    :param terrain_resolution: Section sampling step along the path, in
