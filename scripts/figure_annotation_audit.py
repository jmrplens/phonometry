"""Record, while the figures are being generated, which annotations cannot be read.

A label the reader cannot pick out of the plot fails in one of two ways, and
they are not the same failure:

* **behind.** The letters are drawn on top of a curve, with nothing between
  them. Both strokes are the same weight, and on the dark page close to the
  same lightness. The answer is the opaque chip the corpus already uses
  (``bbox={"boxstyle": "round,pad=0.5", "facecolor": COLOR_PANEL, "edgecolor":
  COLOR_GRID}``), and the defect is a label that should carry one and does not.
* **covered.** The letters are painted over by something drawn later. A chip
  does not answer this one -- the chip is being painted over too -- and the
  fix is a ``zorder`` that puts the label above whatever is on top of it.

Neither subsumes the other, and the second is easy to miss precisely because
matplotlib draws text at zorder 3 and lines at zorder 2: in the ordinary
"behind" defect every letter is fully visible, and merely illegible. So the
two are measured separately and reported as separate kinds, because the advice
they need is different.

Why it is measured here, during generation, rather than read off the shipped
files: ``svg.fonttype = "path"`` means text is written as glyph outlines, so
``.github/images`` contains no ``<text>`` element to find a label in and no
way to ask where its letters are. The matplotlib artists are the only place
the question can be put, and they exist only while the figure is being drawn.

The "behind" measure, in two stages, because the precise one is expensive
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

* **The prefilter** is geometry: for every un-chipped ``Text`` of the figure,
  does any visible artist that puts a stroke down enter its glyph box? Every
  axes counts, not only the one the label lives in -- a label on a ``twinx``
  host is drawn straight through by the curve on its sibling -- and every
  stroking artist counts, not only ``Line2D``: a reflectogram stem drawn as a
  ``LineCollection``, a contour, the outline or the hatching of a patch and
  the arrow of a neighbouring annotation are ink like any other. It runs on
  every figure, needs one draw, and is deliberately generous: it decides which
  figures are worth measuring, and nothing else, so for an artist whose exact
  vertices are not on offer a bounding-box overlap is enough and the pixel
  count settles it afterwards.
* **The measurement** is pixels, and it is what the gate compares. The figure
  is rendered with the labels' letters off and every stroke suppressed (the
  ground), then with one label alone, then with the strokes back; differencing
  gives the ink each paints on that same ground, and the count of pixels in
  both is the answer.

An annotation's own arrow is kept out of its own count twice over, because a
label set aside with a pointer that reaches down to touch the curve is the
pattern this looks *for*. The arrow is a stroke, so it is suppressed in the
render the label's letters are read from, exactly as a curve is; and that
render is masked to the glyph box, which comes from an unbound
``Text.get_window_extent`` and is the letters alone. What is *not* excused is
an arrow across the label next door, which is a black rule through the words
and reads no better than a curve would. It is why the letters are switched off
rather than the labels hidden: hiding an ``Annotation`` takes its arrow with
it, so the stroke to be measured would not be in the render at all. Measured on
two figures identical but for how the one stroke is drawn, the victim scored
287 px as a ``Line2D`` and 0 px as an ``annotate(arrowstyle="-")`` across the
same pixels.

What a stroke is, and what it is not, is load-bearing. A patch or a collection
is suppressed by taking its line width to zero and its hatching away, not by
hiding it, so its *fill* stays in the ground. A filled region behind a label
is a backing -- which is what the chip is for -- and the letters on it read
perfectly: measured on ``metadiffuser_geometry``, hiding the fills as well
scored the five legible slit numbers at 32 to 47 px, straight into the gate.
For a figure whose only ink is ``Line2D`` this is the same arithmetic as
hiding the lines, because a line has no fill to keep.

The geometric answer alone cannot gate: ``get_window_extent`` returns the
font's line box, ascent to descent, plus the leading between the lines of a
multi-line annotation, so a curve can cross the box through the ascender space
above a row of lowercase letters and touch nothing. Measured across the
corpus, a curve inside the box with zero ink on the letters is the *dominant*
class of geometric hit, which is why the box is a prefilter and the pixels are
the rule.

Two things fall out of measuring pixels rather than distances, and both are
wanted. A curve hidden under a filled band contributes nothing, because the
stroke mask is read against a render with every fill in place, so ink
something else paints over never enters it. And a curve that merely ends on
the edge of the box -- the inline curve-end label, which reads fine -- scores
the width of its own end cap against the first letter, a few pixels, an order
of magnitude below anything the checker reports.

The "covered" measure
---------------------

Four renders per label, and it asks the reader's question directly: of the
ink this label lays down, how much fails to survive into the figure as it
ships?

.. code-block:: text

    raised_dark   = render(fig)  label on top, its letters drawn in black
    raised_light  = render(fig)  label on top, its letters drawn in white
    shipped_dark  = render(fig)  label where it ships, its letters in black
    shipped_light = render(fig)  label where it ships, its letters in white
    glyphs  = (raised_dark  != raised_light)  & region
    visible = (shipped_dark != shipped_light) & region
    struck  = glyphs & ~visible

Rendering the label at the top of the stack is the whole trick. Locating it
in a figure that still has the curves drawn over it finds only the part that
already survives, which is the very thing being tested, and returns zero for
every figure in the corpus.

Nothing in it depends on the type of the covering artist, on its zorder, or on
whether the label carries a chip -- which is why it is applied to chipped
labels too. "Has a box" is not "is readable": the convention is a chip *and* a
zorder above the curves, and a chip drawn under the curve is exactly the case
that the behind measure passes and the reader fails. It is not free, so a
label is only measured when some artist that is drawn after it reaches its
box.

What is counted is letters, never chip. That distinction is what makes the
number gateable. The chip is drawn by ``Text.draw``, so raising the label
raises the box with it, and a glyph mask read straight off that render is the
chip's whole rectangle: the count would be mostly fill. Measured both ways
across the corpus the two diverge by up to seventy-seven times:
``rd1367_vs_iso_tonal_es`` scores 237 px of lost chip and 0 px of lost letters:
a legend frame trimming the top-right corner of the box, every character
perfect. The clean population reaches further up than the real one begins, so
no threshold separates the two, and a clipped chip corner is untidy rather
than unreadable. (A second example stood here, ``ship_source_level`` at 384 px
against 5. This branch then moved that formula box to the top right, where
nothing is drawn over it, and its chip now loses nothing. The measurement that
carried the argument is gone even though the argument holds, which is the
hazard of a worked example naming a figure the same branch is free to move.)

So the letters are found by drawing them twice, once in each of
:data:`_INKS`, and differencing the two renders. Everything else in the figure
is identical between them, the chip included, so what is left is the letters
and only the letters. It is also the only mask that survives a letter drawn
over a curve of the label's own colour: a mask read against a render of the
figure *without* the label scores that pixel as unpainted, and the character
the reader has lost goes uncounted.

One correction to the recipe, measured rather than assumed. A zorder orders
artists *inside* one axes, and the figure draws each axes whole, so a label on
the earlier of two axes cannot be lifted over the later one's curve at all: a
synthetic label under an opaque line on a ``twinx`` sibling renders identically
with its zorder at a million, and the bare recipe scores it zero. Where such
an artist reaches the box it is taken away for the pair of renders that
locates the label's ink, and the shipped render still decides what survives.
With no such artist -- every figure with one axes -- nothing is taken away and
this is the recipe unchanged. It is what finds ``transfer_stiffness``, whose
``twinx`` label is painted over by the transmissibility curve on the host that
the figure deliberately puts on top.

One thing it still cannot see, and it is worth writing down. An artist drawn
over a label with ``alpha`` below 1 lets the letters tint the result, so the
pixel does differ from the label-hidden render and counts as surviving: the
same synthetic control at ``alpha=0.9`` scores zero where at 1.0 it scores
346. Where that artist is a *stroke*, the other measure has it, which is why both
are kept. ``sii_masking_chain`` was the example: 345 px under behind and
silent here. It is silent under both now, because this branch handed the
annotation to the twin axes and chipped it, so ``_candidates`` no longer
nominates it at all. Where it is a translucent *fill*, neither does: the fill is a backing to
the behind measure by design, so a wash laid over a label scores 0 and 0
(measured, ``axhspan(alpha=0.55)`` over a label at a higher zorder). The corpus
draws its washes under the labels rather than over them, so it has no instance;
a wash that did move on top would need the third thing neither measure is, a
contrast measure.

Recording is off unless :data:`AUDIT_ENV` names a directory, so a plain
``python scripts/generate_graphs.py`` is untouched: the measurement costs
renders, and nobody generating one figure by hand asked for it. When it is
set, every process that draws figures -- the parent, each spawned pool worker
-- writes its own ``<pid>.json`` fragment there at exit, and
``scripts/check_figure_annotations.py`` merges them. Fragments accumulate:
whoever sets the variable empties the directory first, which is what ``make
graphs`` does.

The record is keyed by the *asset* name, language suffix included
(``foo`` and ``foo_es``), because the two languages are two different
drawings: Spanish prose is longer than English, so a label that clears a curve
in one grows into it in the other. Both light passes are measured; the dark
pass of each is the same geometry in other colours, and it is skipped because
the measurement costs renders and doubling them buys three pixels. Not zero
pixels: forcing the measurement on the dark pass of ten drawings recorded 44
labels, of which 25 came out differently, every one of them by 1 to 3 px
(``airport_sor`` "-12" 42 light against 39 dark). That is anti-aliasing against a different page, not a
different drawing: the behind counts all fall on the dark page and only the
covered ones can rise, by 2 px at the most. So the skip can hide a defect
sitting within three pixels of a threshold, and nothing further from one.

    Two pairs of renders, and each pair asks the same question of a different
    stack: where does this label's own ink land on the page? A pair is the
    label drawn in each of :data:`_INKS` with everything else held still, so
    the two differ exactly where a letter puts ink down and nowhere else.
    Taken with the label lifted to the top of the stack, that is every letter
    it would draw; taken as the figure ships, it is the letters the reader
    actually receives. The difference is what is lost.

    The obvious way to write either half -- does this pixel *change* when the
    label is taken away -- is blind wherever the label's ink and what lies
    against it are the same colour, and a black note over a black rule is not
    a rare figure. Written that way on both sides the two blind spots line up
    and a character the reader has genuinely lost is scored as never drawn;
    written that way on one side only, they no longer line up and a character
    that is perfectly visible is scored as lost. An ink difference has the
    blind spot on neither side, which is why both halves are one.

    Letters, and never the chip: the chip is drawn by ``Text.draw`` and so is
    lifted with the label, but it keeps its own colours in every render here
    and cancels. That is the difference between a number that can be gated
    and one that cannot; the module docstring has the measurements.

    *above* is what a zorder cannot lift the label over, because it lives on
    an axes drawn later. It is taken away for the pair that locates the
    letters -- otherwise the label would still be under it at any zorder, and
    the pair would find only the part that already survives -- and left in
    place for the pair that decides what survives.

    whole ``atexit`` registry in the child before the target runs, and puts
    its own ``_exit_function`` in place of it. A child that inherited
    ``_REGISTERED = True`` would therefore never re-register, and everything
    it went on to measure would be dropped at exit -- a partial recording,
    which the checker's coverage rule turns into "not a full run" rather than
    into a pass, but only after a whole generation run has been paid for.

    Clearing both leaves the child where a spawned worker starts, and its
    first :func:`audit` registers a handler of its own. That registration
    happens after the child has cleared the registry, which is why it
    survives where the inherited one does not.

    No fork in the corpus reaches this today, and the reason is the second
    clause rather than the first: the one fork, the four language/theme
    variants of an animation clip, draws no figure, so nothing there calls
    :func:`audit`. The parallel figure run does use spawned workers, which
    start from a pristine interpreter and register for themselves, but that is
    not what makes the case unreachable: at ``--jobs 1``, and on any machine
    with two cores or fewer where the default resolves to one, every figure is
