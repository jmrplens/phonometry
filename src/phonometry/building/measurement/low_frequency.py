r"""Low-frequency procedure of ISO 16283, shared by all three parts.

Below 100 Hz a dwelling-sized room has too few modes for the central
microphone positions of the default procedure to stand for the whole volume,
so ISO 16283 adds a second measurement in the room corners and combines the
two. The procedure is **not optional**: Part 1 Clause 8.1, Part 2 Clause 8.1
and Part 3 Clause 7.3.1 all say it *shall* be used for the 50 Hz, 63 Hz and
80 Hz one-third-octave bands once the room volume, calculated to the nearest
cubic metre, is smaller than 25 m³. Most bedrooms and bathrooms are under that
line, which is why this sits under the field-measurement entry points rather
than beside them.

**The corner level.** With the source running, the highest level of the set of
measured corners is taken, band by band, and the values for the three bands may
come from three different corners (the NOTE under Formula (12)). Where a single
loudspeaker or tapping machine is moved between q positions those q maxima are
energy-averaged, Part 1 Formula (12) and Part 2 Formula (15):

.. math::

    L_\mathrm{Corner} = 10 \lg \frac{p^2_\mathrm{Corner,1} + \cdots +
    p^2_\mathrm{Corner,q}}{q\,p_0^2}

Part 3 numbers no such formula: Clause 7.3.4 defines :math:`L_\mathrm{2,Corner}`
as the maximum over corners and averages the *level difference* over
loudspeaker positions later (Clause 9.6.3, Formula (8)). The maximum is the
q = 1 case of the formula above, so the same code answers all three.

**The combination.** The low-frequency energy-average level weighs the corner
level one third against two thirds of the default-procedure level. Part 1
Formula (13), Part 2 Formula (16) and Part 3 Formula (5) print it identically,
only the subscripts of the level symbols changing:

.. math::

    L_\mathrm{LF} = 10 \lg \left[ \frac{10^{0,1 L_\mathrm{Corner}} +
    (2 \cdot 10^{0,1 L})}{3} \right]

**The reverberation time.** Under the same 25 m³ trigger, Part 1 Clause 10.4,
Part 2 Clause 10.4 and Part 3 Clause 8.4 stop the 50 Hz, 63 Hz and 80 Hz
one-third-octave reverberation times being measured at all and put one 63 Hz
*octave* band value in their place, used for all three bands. It is a
prescription about what to measure, not a claim that the octave value equals
the three one-third-octave ones: in a small room there are too few modes for a
one-third-octave decay to be single-sloped, and in timber or steel frame
construction the decay can be shorter than the analyser's own one-third-octave
filter (NOTE 1 and NOTE 2 under each of those clauses). Below the trigger there
is no default value to fall back on either, because Clause 10.3 / 8.3 confines
the default reverberation-time procedure to 100 Hz and above once the room is
under 25 m³.

**Which room.** Part 1 applies the corner procedure to "the source and/or
receiving room when *its* volume" is under the line, so a 18 m³ source room
next to a 40 m³ receiving room gets the corner treatment on :math:`L_1` alone.
Parts 2 and 3 have only a receiving room to treat. The 63 Hz octave
substitution is keyed to the **receiving** room in all three parts, Part 1
included: its Clause 10 is headed "Reverberation time in the receiving room",
its Clause 10.1 scopes the whole clause to that room and its Clause 10.4 names
it again. So that asymmetry is real and this module encodes it: a source-room
procedure that carries a 63 Hz octave reverberation time is refused. Part 1
Clause 6 does contradict its own Clause 10 on this and asks for the
reverberation-time procedure "in the source and/or receiving room"; that is a
defect of the printed text, registered in ``docs/ERRATA.md``.

**Not optional, and not silent.** Clause 8.1 (Part 3: Clause 7.3.1) says the
procedure *shall* be used, so the three entry points that consume this module
do not simply wait to be asked. When the room volume and the band centres are
both in hand, a room that rounds below the trigger and names the three bands
without bringing a :class:`LowFrequencyProcedure` gets a
:class:`LowFrequencyWarning` rather than a quiet answer several decibels away
from the ISO 16283 one. They warn rather than refuse: the corner measurements
may genuinely not exist, and the default-procedure spectrum is what a reader
compares the ISO 16283 one against.

**Which methods.** Part 3 restricts the whole procedure to the element and
global *loudspeaker* methods; Clause 6 NOTE 1 records that there is no
experience of running it with traffic as the source, and the heading of
Clause 7.3 carries the restriction. Part 2 restricts it to the tapping machine
(the heading of its Clause 8), while the 63 Hz octave reverberation time of its
Clause 10.4 also feeds the rubber-ball quantity :math:`L'_\mathrm{i,Fmax,V,T}`.

**No numeric oracle.** Neither part publishes a worked example of this
procedure: Annexes B and C of Parts 1 and 2 are blank recording forms and the
"Examples" of Annexes D and E are loudspeaker-position drawings. The
conformance of this module therefore rests on closed forms and on printed
numbers rather than on a tabulated result; see
:mod:`scripts.conformance.domains.building` and ``docs/CONFORMANCE.md`` for the
checks that stand in for one.
