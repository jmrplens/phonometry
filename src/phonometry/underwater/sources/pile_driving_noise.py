r"""Radiated underwater sound from percussive pile driving (ISO 18406:2017).

Percussive pile driving radiates a train of impulsive acoustic pulses, one per
hammer strike. ISO 18406 characterises them with:

* :func:`single_strike_sel` -- the single-strike sound exposure level
  ``SEL_ss`` of one pulse (Formulae 3-4), reusing the 1 µPa²·s reference.
* :func:`cumulative_sel` / :func:`cumulative_sel_identical` -- the cumulative
  sound exposure level over N strikes (Formulae 8-9); for N identical strikes
  :math:`\mathrm{SEL}_{\mathrm{cum}} =
  \mathrm{SEL}_{\mathrm{ss}} + 10 \log_{10} N`.
* :func:`pile_strike_metrics` -- a :class:`PileStrikeResult` bundling the
  single-strike SEL, the peak sound pressure level, the SPL/Leq and the
  90 %-energy pulse duration for one recorded strike, with a ``.plot()``.
* :func:`strike_sel_spectrum` -- the same single-strike SEL resolved into
  fractional-octave bands (ISO 18406 6.4.2.2), the input a marine-mammal
  assessment needs: feed it to
  :func:`~phonometry.underwater.bioacoustics.weighting.weighted_exposure` to
  obtain the weighted cumulative SEL of a piling campaign and its margin
  against the regulatory injury and TTS criteria.
