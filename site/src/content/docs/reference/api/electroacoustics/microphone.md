Rated microphone characteristics (IEC 60268-4).

A microphone measurement/rating report gathers the *rated characteristics*
IEC 60268-4:2014 defines around a measured free-field frequency response: the
**free-field sensitivity** and its level re 1 V/Pa (clauses 11.1/11.2.1), the
**frequency response** with the manufacturer's tolerance (12.1) and the
**effective frequency range** read against that tolerance (12.2), the
**directional pattern** and the **directivity index** (13.1/13.2), the
**equivalent sound pressure level due to inherent noise** (17), the **overload
sound pressure level** at a stated total-harmonic-distortion limit (14.2/15.2),
the **rated impedance** and the **rated minimum permitted load impedance**
(10.2/10.3) and the **rated power supply** (9.1). This module bundles those
into a single [`MicrophoneCharacteristics`](/phonometry/reference/api/electroacoustics/microphone/#microphonecharacteristics) result whose `report` method
renders the IEC 60268-4 rated-characteristics fiche, with the characteristic
graphs laid out to the IEC 60263:1982 scale conventions.

Four of the characteristics are *computed* from the standard's own definitions
so the report never merely repeats a manufacturer number:

* **Sensitivity level** (11.1). The sensitivity `M` is the ratio of the
  output voltage to the sound pressure, in volts per pascal; its level is

      L_M = 20 lg(M / M_r),   M_r = 1 V/Pa,

  the rated sensitivity referring to the standard reference frequency of
  1 000 Hz (11.3). This is the first clean-room oracle: 12,5 mV/Pa returns
  `20 lg 0,0125 = -38,06` dB re 1 V/Pa exactly.

* **Effective frequency range** (12.2). The range of frequencies over which
  the response does not deviate by more than a specified amount from the ideal
  (flat) response through the reference-frequency level. The band edges are
  the interpolated frequencies where the relative response crosses the
  `+/- tolerance` limits on either side of the reference frequency, which is
  the second oracle: a response crossing a limit at chosen frequencies returns
  exactly those frequencies.

* **Directivity index** (13.2.2). `D = 20 lg(M_0 / M_diff)` where the
  diffuse-field sensitivity of a rotationally symmetric pattern follows
  11.2.2 a):

      M_diff^2 = (1/2) * integral over 0..pi of M^2(theta) sin(theta) dtheta.

  For the ideal cardioid `M(theta) = M_0 (1 + cos theta) / 2` the integral
  is `M_0^2 / 3`, so `D = 10 lg 3 = 4,77` dB, the third oracle.

* **Equivalent sound pressure level due to inherent noise** (17.2 d/e). The
  equivalent sound pressure is the ratio of the weighted inherent-noise output
  voltage to the rated free-field sensitivity, `p_N = U_N / M`, and its
  level is `L_N = 20 lg(p_N / p_0)` with `p_0 = 20` uPa, the fourth
  oracle. The overload sound pressure level (15.2.2) is read from a measured
  distortion-against-level curve as the interpolated sound pressure level
  where the distortion reaches the specified limit.

Assemble the rated microphone characteristics for an IEC 60268-4 report.

The sensitivity level (11.1), the effective frequency range (12.2), the
directivity index (13.2.2, when a rear-reaching pattern is supplied) and
the equivalent noise level (17.2, when the noise voltage is supplied) are
computed from the standard's definitions; the optional directional, noise
and distortion data feed the corresponding report panels.

Render the IEC 60268-4 microphone-characteristics fiche to a PDF.

Writes a one-page rated-characteristics data sheet: the standard-basis
line (IEC 60268-4:2014, graphs to IEC 60263:1982), an optional metadata
header, the rated-characteristics table beside the free-field response
with its tolerance band and effective-range markers, the directional,
inherent-noise and distortion panels for the data supplied, a boxed
sensitivity/range result, an optional equivalent-noise verdict when a
requirement is given, and the footer.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `path` | Destination path of the PDF file. |
| `metadata` | Optional [`ReportMetadata`](/phonometry/reference/api/building/insulation/#reportmetadata) supplying the header identity and, through `requirement`, a maximum permitted equivalent noise level (dB SPL) the verdict row compares against. |
| `engine` | Rendering back end; only `"reportlab"` is supported. |
| `verbose` | Accepted for a uniform `.report()` signature; the fiche has one layout, so it has no effect. |

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
