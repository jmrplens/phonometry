"""What a verdict indicator is called, where it is served from, what it says.

:mod:`conformance.badges` draws the indicators; this module is everything a
document needs in order to *cite* one. The split is not tidiness, it is a
constraint: the ``pr-comment`` job in ``.github/workflows/python-app.yml``
installs nothing at all. It reads two committed JSON files on the standard
library alone, deliberately, because it used to spend 45 s rebuilding a report
the ``conformance`` job had already proven current. Drawing a badge needs
matplotlib, to turn a committed font into glyph outlines; citing one needs a
filename and a URL. Only the citing half may be imported from that job, so
only the citing half is here.

Three documents cite these names and none of them writes one down: the
Markdown report through :mod:`conformance.render`, the sticky pull-request
comment through ``.github/scripts/comment_pr.py``, and the README by hand.
``tests/test_conformance_badges.py`` scans the whole tracked tree for a
citation of a file nothing generates, which is what turns a rename into a
failing test rather than a broken image nobody notices.

**Why a raw URL and not a relative path.** The sticky pull-request comment is
the case that settles it: it is rendered on a different page of a different
host, where a path relative to ``docs/`` resolves to nothing, and the report
and the comment build their markup separately and resolve it through the same
``asset_url`` here, so a path that is wrong is wrong on both. Measured against the
live repository, GitHub serves ``raw.githubusercontent.com`` for this
repository untouched, while it rewrites ``img.shields.io`` and the other
third-party badge hosts through ``camo.githubusercontent.com`` - so there is
no proxy cache between a reader and these files, and a badge regenerated on
``main`` is live within the five minutes raw's ``cache-control`` asks for.

    :param verdict: The verdict string the artefact stores.

    :param alt: What a reader gets when the image does not arrive. It is the
        verdict in words, never the name of a picture. It is also the
        accessible name of the link GitHub wraps every Markdown image in - a
        ``<picture>`` is the only embedding that escapes that wrapper - so it
        may not be empty: an unnamed link announces its URL, and this document
        would hold 569 of them.

        The duplication it costs is real and was measured rather than waved
        away. Rendered through GitHub's own renderer, the report holds 576
        links, 569 named "Pass" and 4 "By design", and a reader with images
        off sees the word twice in the cell. What bounds it is that the report
        ships with all 60 of its sections collapsed, because every check
        passes: 571 of those links sit inside a closed ``<details>``,
        ``checkVisibility()`` is false for every one of them, and the reader
        meets five - three documents and the two legend marks. Opening one
        12-row domain brings the total to seventeen. Escaping the wrapper
        instead, with a ``<picture>`` around an ``alt=""`` image on every row,
        was measured at +73.9 kB against the +10.0 kB the reference-style mark
        costs, to remove a duplicated word from rows a reader has to open one
        section at a time to reach.
    :param label: The Markdown link-reference label the tables use. Reference
        style rather than inline, because a definition resolves document-wide:
        the per-row cost is the 16-character label instead of a 117-character
        URL, which is what keeps 566 illustrated rows affordable.

    A ``<picture>`` whose ``<source>`` carries the dark variant is the
    mechanism GitHub itself documents and the one the README already uses.
    What it follows depends on who renders it, and both halves of that were
    measured across all four crossings of desktop theme and GitHub theme.

    On github.com the pair follows the reader's GitHub theme. GitHub upgrades
    every ``<picture>`` into a ``<themed-picture>`` custom element which
    rewrites the source's ``media`` to ``not all`` to force the light file and
    to ``(prefers-color-scheme: light),(prefers-color-scheme: dark)`` to force
    the dark one, so a light desktop with GitHub set to dark loads the ``_dark``
    file on a #0d1117 body, and the reverse loads the light file on white. All
    four crossings land correctly.

    Anywhere the same HTML is rendered without GitHub's JavaScript - the
    ``/markdown`` API output under GitHub's own stylesheet, an editor preview,
    a mirror - the element never upgrades, the ``media`` stays
    ``(prefers-color-scheme: dark)`` and the desktop decides. Two of the four
    crossings then serve the wrong twin.

    That is survivable, and it is the real reason a pair is safe here: the
    banner paints its own card rather than sitting on the page's ground.
    Measured, its ink reads at 14.84:1 on the light card and 15.91:1 on the
    dark one whatever page it lands on, and in the two mismatch cases the card
    still separates from the page at 17.3:1 and 17.8:1. The failure mode is a
    card of the wrong colour, never an unreadable one. A per-row mark could
    not make that trade, because it has no card of its own.

    Emitted on one line: the pair sits inside a paragraph, and a hard-wrapped
    element puts a ``<`` at the start of a line, which the Markdown-hazard
    gate reads as the start of a block.

    No link around it. The README wraps its own copy in one, because there the
    banner is an invitation to go and read the report; in the report itself,
    and in a comment that already links the report twice in its footer, a link
    would only lead back to where the reader is.
