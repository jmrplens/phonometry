Building acoustic performance prediction (EN 12354-1/-2:2000).

This is the **prediction** counterpart of the measurement modules
(:mod:`phonometry.lab_insulation` for laboratory ``R``/``Ln`` and
:mod:`phonometry.insulation` for field ``R'``/``L'n``). EN 12354 estimates the
*in-situ* apparent performance of a building from the laboratory performance of
its elements, adding the flanking transmission that a field measurement would
capture but a laboratory measurement suppresses.

Both parts have a *detailed* per-band model and a *simplified* single-number
model. This module implements the **simplified single-number model** (Part 1
Clause 4.4, Part 2 Clause 4.3): it takes the weighted single-number ratings of
the elements (``Rw`` of walls/floors, ``ΔRw``/``ΔLw`` of linings/coverings and
the ``Kij`` vibration-reduction indices of the junctions) and predicts the
apparent weighted rating (``R'w`` airborne, ``L'n,w`` impact). The simplified
model is exact for ``RA`` and a good approximation for ``R'w`` (Part 1
Clause 4.4.1), with a reported standard deviation of about 2 dB (Clause 5).

**Airborne, Formula (26).** The apparent weighted sound reduction index is the
energetic sum of the direct path ``Dd`` and, for every flanking element, the
three flanking paths ``Ff``, ``Df`` and ``Fd``::

    R'w = -10 lg[ 10^(-RDd,w/10) + Σ 10^(-RFf,w/10)
                 + Σ 10^(-RDf,w/10) + Σ 10^(-RFd,w/10) ]

with the direct path ``RDd,w = Rs,w + ΔRDd,w`` (Formula 27) and each flanking
path (Formula 28a) ``Rij,w = (Ri,w + Rj,w)/2 + ΔRij,w + Kij + 10 lg(Ss/(l0·lf))``
where ``l0 = 1 m`` is the reference coupling length.

**Junctions, Annex E.** The vibration reduction index ``Kij`` of rigid cross
(E.3) and T (E.4) junctions, junctions with flexible interlayers (E.5),
lightweight façade junctions (E.6), junctions of lightweight double-leaf walls
with homogeneous elements (E.7) or with other coupled double-leaf walls (E.8),
and corners / thickness changes (E.9) are empirical functions of the mass
ratio ``M = lg(m'⊥,i / m'i)``. A minimum value ``Kij,min`` follows from
the Kij,min relation of Clause 4.4.2 (printed as Eq. (23)
in the BS EN 12354-1:2000 edition).

**Impact, Formula (21).** ``L'n,w = Ln,w,eq − ΔLw + K`` with the bare-floor
equivalent level ``Ln,w,eq`` (Annex B ``164 − 35 lg(m'/m'0)``), the covering
improvement ``ΔLw`` (ISO 717-2) and the flanking correction ``K`` from Table 1.

Clause citations refer to EN 12354-1:2000 (airborne) or EN 12354-2:2000 (impact).
