"""ITU-R BS.468-4 clause 2: the psophometric quasi-peak programme-level meter.

Clause 2 prints no time constant, no rise time and no transfer function. It
specifies the detector through eleven acceptance windows (Tables 2 and 3),
one absolute calibration (clause 2.6) and four small requirements that a
float64 chain satisfies by construction. This file is organised the same
way, and each group says which of the three it is:

* **Conformance.** The eleven windows, run at five sample rates. This is the
  whole conformance statement the Recommendation authorises for a detector.
* **A self-imposed regression bound.** How close the readings sit to the
  *reference* column, which the standard does not require them to match, and
  how little they move between sample rates.
* **True by construction.** Clauses 2.1 (attenuators), 2.3 (overload
  linearity), 2.4 (reversibility) and 2.5 (overswing). Rectification,
  first-order recursions and a maximum are positively homogeneous and cannot
  overshoot a monotone step, so these pass exactly rather than nearly. They
  are kept as live tests because the first three would catch a chain that
  stopped being homogeneous and the fourth would catch a second-order
  reading device added for realism.

The windows themselves are transcribed in ``tests/reference_data/broadcast``
from the rendered page, independently of the copy the module carries.

# The module and all three editions of its page publish how far each constant
# can move before one of the eleven windows fails. That is a claim about the
# standard, so it is pinned from both sides: each published edge must conform,
# and a step beyond it must not. Without the second half the range could be
# quietly narrowed and nothing would notice.
#
# These figures are only measurable because the chain takes the ballistics as
# an argument. While ``_calibration_factor`` and ``_steady_reference`` were
# keyed on the sample rate alone, moving the module constant left them
# answering with a reference computed for other ballistics, and the same value
# passed or failed depending on the order the probes ran in.


#: Published marginal range of each constant, in seconds, and a step outside
#: it. Marginal: measured with the other two frozen. They are not a box, which
#: :func:`test_two_constants_at_their_edges_leave_the_region` holds down.
