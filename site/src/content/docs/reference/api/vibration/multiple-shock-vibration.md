Whole-body vibration containing multiple shocks (ISO 2631-5:2018).

Implements the normative Clause 5 spinal-response model and the Annex C
assessment of adverse health effects for the vertical (`z`) axis.

The 2018 edition is vertical-axis only by design: clause 4 (delineation,
item a) neglects the `x` and `y` contributions to spinal compression, the
seat-to-spine transfer function of clause 5.2 is the vertical seat-to-lumbar
response, and the Annex C stress conversion `mz` is the vertical one. The
horizontal spinal model of the withdrawn 2004 edition is not reproduced.
Assess horizontal whole-body exposure with the ISO 2631-1 metrics in this
domain instead: the weighted r.m.s. acceleration
([`weighted_acceleration`](/phonometry/reference/api/vibration/human-vibration/#weighted_acceleration)) and the vibration dose
value ([`vibration_dose_value`](/phonometry/reference/api/vibration/human-vibration/#vibration_dose_value)).

A seat-to-spine transfer function `H(w)` (clause 5.2, Formula 1) maps the
measured seat acceleration `az(t)` to the spinal response acceleration
`Az(t) = F^-1[H(w) * F[az(t)]]` (Formula 2). The standard assumes a
*conditioned* input: `H` has unity transmissibility at 0 Hz, so any DC
offset in the record (e.g. the gravity component of a non-AC-coupled
accelerometer) passes straight into `Az(t)` and corrupts the response
peaks; remove the mean (high-pass) before processing. The acceleration
dose is
`Dz = 1.07 * (sum_i Az,i**6)**(1/6)` over the positive response peaks
(Formula 3), scaled to a daily dose `Dzd = Dz * (td/tm)**(1/6)` (Formula 4/5).

Annex C turns the daily dose into an injury risk: the daily compressive stress
`Sd = mz * Dzd` (Formula C.1), the age-cumulated stress variable
`R = [sum_i (Sd * N**(1/6) / (Su,i - Sstat))**6]**(1/6)` (Formulae C.3/C.4)
and the Weibull probability of lumbar injury `P = 1 - exp(-(R/alpha)**beta)`
(Formula C.5, Table C.1).

The Annex A / Annex E model (intervertebral compressive forces via a
finite-element model distributed by ISO) is not reproducible from the standard
text and is out of scope.

```

Full multiple-shock assessment from a seat acceleration time history.

Chains the Clause 5 dose and the Annex C risk: spinal response (Formula 2),
acceleration dose (Formula 3), daily dose (Formula 4), compressive stress
(C.1), stress variable `R` (C.3) and injury probability (C.5). The input
must be conditioned (DC-removed); see [`spinal_response`](/phonometry/reference/api/vibration/multiple-shock-vibration/#spinal_response).

The model is vertical-axis only (clause 4a of the 2018 edition); for
horizontal whole-body exposure use the ISO 2631-1 metrics in this domain
([`weighted_acceleration`](/phonometry/reference/api/vibration/human-vibration/#weighted_acceleration),

    *,
    language: str = 'en',
    **kwargs: Any,
) -> Axes
```

Plot the injury-probability curve with this assessment's `R`.

Requires matplotlib (`pip install phonometry[plot]`); returns the
`Axes`.

## response_peaks

```python
response_peaks(response: ArrayLike) -> np.ndarray
```

Positive response peaks `Az,i` (clause 5.3).

A peak is the maximum value of the response between two consecutive zero
crossings; only positive peaks are counted.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `response` | The spinal response acceleration `Az(t)`. |

**Returns:** The positive peak values, in the order they occur.

## seat_to_spine_transfer

```python
seat_to_spine_transfer(frequencies: ArrayLike) -> np.ndarray
```

Seat-to-spine transfer function `H(w)` (clause 5.2, Formula 1).

A single complex zero and six complex poles map the seat acceleration to
the vertical spinal response; the transmissibility is unity at 0 Hz.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `frequencies` | Frequencies at which to evaluate `H`, in hertz. |

**Returns:** The complex frequency response, aligned with `frequencies`.

## spinal_response

```python
spinal_response(acceleration: ArrayLike, fs: float) -> np.ndarray
```

Vertical spinal response `Az(t)` (clause 5.2, Formula 2).

Applies the seat-to-spine transfer function to the measured conditioned
seat acceleration in the frequency domain and returns the time-domain
response by the inverse transform.

The input must be **conditioned (DC-removed)**: the transfer function is
unity at 0 Hz by design (clause 5.2), so a DC offset (e.g. the 1 g
gravity component of a DC-coupled accelerometer) is passed unattenuated
and produces a spurious constant shift in `Az(t)` that corrupts the
positive response peaks of the dose. Subtract the mean (or high-pass) of
`az(t)` before calling.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `acceleration` | Measured, conditioned (zero-mean) vertical seat acceleration `az(t)`, m/s2. |
| `fs` | Sampling frequency, in hertz. |

**Returns:** The spinal response acceleration `Az(t)`, m/s2, same length.

## static_stress

```python
static_stress(mz: float = 0.029) -> float
```

Static compressive stress `Sstat = mz * 9.81` (Annex C), MPa.

## ultimate_strength

```python
ultimate_strength(
    age: ArrayLike,
    *,
    sex: Literal['male', 'female'] = 'male',
) -> np.ndarray
```

Ultimate lumbar strength `Su` at an age (Annex C, Formula C.4).

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `age` | Age `b + i`, in years. |
| `sex` | `"male"` or `"female"` (sets the age slope `Sage`). |

**Returns:** The ultimate strength `Su = 6.75 - Sage*(b+i)`, MPa.
