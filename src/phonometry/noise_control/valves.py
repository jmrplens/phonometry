r"""Control valve aerodynamic noise (IEC 60534-8-3:2010).

A control valve throttles a compressible fluid by turning pressure into
velocity and then throwing that velocity away in a free jet inside the pipe.
A small, well-characterised fraction of the jet's stream power comes back as
sound, most of it radiated not by the valve but by the **pipe wall
downstream**, which is why the method ends in a transmission loss and not in a
sound power level.

The standard is a chain with a branch in the middle. The branch is the
**regime**: how far the throttling has gone, from subsonic flow in the vena
contracta (regime I) through the onset of choking to the fully developed
shock cells of regime V. Five printed pressure ratios,
Equations (3) to (7), cut the differential pressure ratio :math:`x` into
those five intervals, and Table 3 gives each one its own Mach number, its own
acoustical efficiency and its own peak frequency. Everything before the
branch (the pressure ratios, the jet diameter) and everything after it (the
internal level at the pipe wall, the pipe transmission loss, the level
outside) is common to all five.

**What is new in the 2010 edition, and what this module therefore does.** The
1997 method produced one number. This one produces a **third-octave
spectrum**: Equation (19) spreads the internal level around the peak
frequency, Equation (20a) gives the pipe a transmission loss that changes with
frequency through the ring and coincidence frequencies of Equations (21) to
(23), and only Equation (25) collapses the result back to a single A-weighted
level at 1 m. The band set is the 33 one-third-octave bands from 12,5 Hz to
20 kHz, printed as Table 5.

**Three things in Annex A do not reproduce themselves**, and all three are
recorded in ``docs/ERRATA.md``:

* The piping geometry factor is printed as :math:`F_p = 0{,}98`, but every one
  of the six printed vena contracta pressures needs :math:`0{,}984` to come
  out. The five examples that print a value of :math:`p_{vc}` all give
  :math:`(F_{LP}/F_P)^2 = 0{,}647\,83`, which is :math:`F_p = 0{,}984` to six
  digits and not :math:`0{,}98`.
* The equivalent orifice diameter is printed as :math:`d_o = 0{,}010` m in all
  six columns, where Equation (8c) with the annex's own :math:`N_O = 6` and
  :math:`A = 0{,}00137` m² gives :math:`0{,}102` m. The valve style modifier
  printed on the next row, :math:`F_d = 0{,}30`, is the ratio of the printed
  :math:`d_H = 0{,}030` m to :math:`0{,}102` m, so the annex computed with the
  larger value and printed the smaller one.
* Two frequency factors of Table A.2 are printed one power of ten low,
  :math:`G_{x,5}` and :math:`G_{x,10}`, in a column Table 6 makes
  proportional to :math:`f_i^4` and which therefore has to rise. The
  transmission losses printed two rows below them are what the corrected
  factors give.

This module implements Clause 5, the standard trim case. The noise-reducing
trims of Clause 6, the expander of Clause 7 and the hydrodynamic case of
IEC 60534-8-4 are separate.
