Phase utilities: minimum phase, group delay and excess phase.

For a causal, stable, minimum-phase system the log-magnitude and the phase
of the frequency response form a Hilbert-transform pair (Bendat & Piersol,
*Random Data*, 4th ed., 2010, Sec. 13.1.4; Oppenheim & Schafer,
*Discrete-Time Signal Processing*, Ch. 12): the phase is fully determined
by ``|H(f)|``. This module computes that **minimum phase** with the real
cepstrum -- fold the inverse transform of ``ln|H|`` onto positive
quefrencies and transform back -- and derives the standard decomposition
of a measured response,

``H(f) = H_min(f) * H_ap(f)`` with
``phi_excess(f) = phi(f) - phi_min(f)``,

whose all-pass **excess phase** collects pure latency and any genuine
non-minimum-phase behaviour (reflections, non-invertible zeros): the part
of the phase no stable causal equalizer can remove. The **group delay**
``tau_g = -(1/2pi) * dphi/df`` is estimated from the unwrapped phase.

Sampling precautions (documented, and the reason for the ``oversample``
padding): the estimate operates on a *uniformly sampled* one-sided response
(DC to Nyquist inclusive, the layout of ``numpy.fft.rfft`` and of
:func:`phonometry.impulse_response` spectra). The real cepstrum of the
sampled log-magnitude is time-aliased when the grid is coarse relative to
how sharp the response is, so the magnitude is resampled onto an
``oversample`` times denser grid by exact trigonometric (zero-padded
even-sequence) interpolation before the logarithm and the phase is read
back on the original bins. Magnitude zeros (a response that vanishes at
DC or Nyquist, e.g. a band-pass) are not minimum-phase-representable:
bins below a relative floor are clipped, and the reconstruction is only
accurate away from them. On a strictly minimum-phase response (all poles
and zeros inside the unit circle) sampled on an adequate grid the
reconstruction matches the true phase to better than ``1e-12`` rad -- the
tolerance the biquad oracle pins in the tests; near-circle zeros on
coarse grids degrade it and are what ``oversample`` mitigates.
