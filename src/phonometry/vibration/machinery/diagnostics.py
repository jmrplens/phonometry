r"""Kinematic fault frequencies of rotating machinery (Norton & Karczub Ch. 8).

Condition monitoring starts with arithmetic, not with signal processing: every
rolling-contact bearing, gear pair, induction motor and bladed rotor excites a
family of **discrete frequencies fixed by its geometry and its shaft speed**.
Knowing where those lines fall turns a featureless envelope spectrum into a
diagnosis, because a peak is only evidence when it sits on a named line.

This module computes the families set out in M. P. Norton and D. G. Karczub,
*Fundamentals of Noise and Vibration Analysis for Engineers* (2nd ed., CUP
2003), Section 8.4 (8.4.1 gears, 8.4.3 bearings, 8.4.4 fans and blowers,
8.4.7 pumps, 8.4.8 electrical equipment), and hands them to the signal chain
that already exists in :mod:`phonometry.signals`: band-pass the structural
resonance the defect impacts ring, detect its envelope and transform it
(:func:`~phonometry.signals.envelope.envelope_spectrum`), average
synchronously with the shaft
(:func:`~phonometry.signals.synchronous_average.time_synchronous_average`)
or collapse the harmonic families in the cepstrum
(:func:`~phonometry.signals.cepstrum.cepstrum`). The result object's
:meth:`FaultFrequencyResult.plot` draws the predicted lines **on top of a
measured envelope spectrum**, which is the working view.

**Rolling-contact bearings** (Eqs. 8.4 to 8.14, after Shahan & Kamperman).
With shaft speed ``N`` in r/min, ``Z`` rolling elements of diameter ``d`` on
a pitch diameter ``D`` and a contact angle ``phi``, writing
:math:`g = (d/D) \cos\phi` and :math:`f_\mathrm{s} = N/60`:

.. math::

   \mathrm{FTF} = \frac{f_\mathrm{s}}{2}(1 - g)
   \qquad \text{cage, stationary outer race} \tag{8.5}

   \mathrm{FTF_{rel}} = f_\mathrm{s} - \mathrm{FTF}
   \qquad \text{cage seen from the shaft} \tag{8.11}

   \mathrm{BSF} = \frac{f_\mathrm{s}}{2} \frac{D}{d} (1 - g^2)
   \qquad \text{element rotation} \tag{8.7}

   \mathrm{BDF} = 2\, \mathrm{BSF}
   \qquad \text{element spin (both races)} \tag{8.10}

   \mathrm{BPFO} = Z \frac{f_\mathrm{s}}{2}(1 - g)
   \qquad \text{element pass, outer race} \tag{8.8}

   \mathrm{BPFI} = Z \frac{f_\mathrm{s}}{2}(1 + g)
   \qquad \text{element pass, inner race} \tag{8.9}

so :math:`\mathrm{BPFO} + \mathrm{BPFI} = Z f_\mathrm{s}` exactly, and
:math:`\mathrm{BPFO} = Z\, \mathrm{FTF}`. Norton notes that
Eqs. (8.8) and (8.14), and (8.9) and (8.13), are identical: ``BPFO`` and
``BPFI`` do not depend on which race turns. Only the cage does, and with the
outer race rotating it becomes :math:`(f_\mathrm{s}/2)(1 + g)` (Eq. 8.6).

**Gears** (Eq. 8.3). The gear-meshing (tooth-passing) frequency of a wheel
with ``n_teeth`` teeth is :math:`\mathrm{GMF} = n_{\text{teeth}} f_\mathrm{s}`, with
integer harmonics. A discrete tooth fault adds shaft-rate lines and low,
flat sidebands around every mesh harmonic; distributed wear raises tall
sideband groups at :math:`k\, \mathrm{GMF} \pm m f_\mathrm{s}`.

**Induction motors** (Eqs. 8.19, 8.20). The three lines always present in a
motor bearing signal are ``fs`` (mechanical unbalance), :math:`2 f_\mathrm{s}`
(misalignment with the driven load) and :math:`2 f_\mathrm{e}` (non-uniform air gap,
torque pulses and the electrical faults). Norton's Eq. (8.19) writes the
supply frequency as :math:`f_\mathrm{e} = f_\mathrm{s} p / 2` for ``p`` magnetic poles, which
is the synchronous, zero-slip form; this module uses the slip-consistent
:math:`f_\mathrm{e} = f_\mathrm{s} p / (2 (1 - s))`, identical at :math:`s = 0` and the only
version that makes the rotor-slot harmonics of Eq. (8.20),

.. math::

   f_\mathrm{sh} = f_\mathrm{e} \left[ \frac{2 R}{p}(1 - s) \pm 2 (n - 1) \right]
   \tag{8.20}

collapse to the physical rotor-bar passing rate :math:`R f_\mathrm{s}` at
:math:`n = 1` for ``R`` rotor bars. Dynamic eccentricity dresses that line
with sidebands at :math:`\pm` the shaft rate and :math:`\pm` the slip
frequency.

**Fans, blowers and pumps** (Eqs. 8.15 to 8.18). The blade-passing frequency
of an impeller with ``N`` blades is :math:`f_\mathrm{b} = n N f_\mathrm{s}`; a pump's
hydraulic pulsations follow the same form with ``N`` pumping events per
revolution (Eq. 8.18), and a rotary positive-displacement blower repeats
four times per revolution. In a ducted axial fan the blade-vane interaction
sets up rotating pressure patterns with :math:`m_\mathrm{L} = n N \pm k V` lobes for
``V`` vanes (Eq. 8.16), turning at :math:`n N f_\mathrm{s} / m_\mathrm{L}` (Eq. 8.17): a
pattern that spins faster than the blades themselves, and the reason a
careful choice of ``N`` and ``V`` matters for radiated power.

    The three lines always present in a motor bearing vibration signal are
    ``1x`` (mechanical unbalance), ``2x`` (misalignment with the driven load)
    and ``2fe`` (a non-uniform air gap, torque pulses and the winding/rotor-bar
    electrical faults). Rotor defects that produce static or dynamic air-gap
    eccentricity are read on the **slot harmonics** of the stator core,

    :math:`f_\mathrm{sh} = f_\mathrm{e}\left[\left(\dfrac{2R}{p}\right)(1-s) \pm 2(n-1)\right]
    = R f_\mathrm{s} \pm 2(n-1) f_\mathrm{e}`

    for ``R`` rotor bars, ``p`` magnetic poles (not pole pairs), unit slip
    ``s`` and ``n = 1, 2, ...``. Dynamic eccentricity modulates the dominant
    slot harmonic at +/- the shaft rate and +/- the slip frequency, which is
    what *sidebands* adds around ``fsh``.

    Give the slip directly, or give the mains *supply_frequency* and let it be
    derived from ``fe`` and the measured shaft speed. The supply frequency is
    taken as :math:`f_\mathrm{e} = f_\mathrm{s} p / (2(1-s))`: Norton's Eq. (8.19) writes
    :math:`f_\mathrm{e} = f_\mathrm{s} p / 2`, which is the same expression at zero slip but
    does not reduce Eq. (8.20) to the physical rotor-bar passing rate
    ``R fs`` when the machine is loaded.

    With a non-zero slip the pole-pass line :math:`F_\mathrm{P} = p\,f_{\text{slip}}`
    is included as well. That name is standard condition-monitoring practice
    rather than Norton's: he gives the slip frequency itself as the sideband
    spacing of a broken rotor bar (his Section 8.4.8) and does not multiply
    it by the pole count.
