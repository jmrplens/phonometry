Control valve aerodynamic noise (IEC 60534-8-3:2010).

A control valve throttles a compressible fluid by turning pressure into
velocity and then throwing that velocity away in a free jet inside the pipe.
A small, well-characterised fraction of the jet's stream power comes back as
sound, most of it radiated not by the valve but by the **pipe wall
downstream**, which is why the method ends in a transmission loss and not in a
sound power level.

The standard is a chain with a branch in the middle. The branch is the
**regime**: how far the throttling has gone, from subsonic flow in the vena
contracta (regime I) through the onset of choking to the fully developed
shock cells of regime V. Five printed pressure ratios,
Equations (3) to (7), cut the differential pressure ratio $x$ into
those five intervals, and Table 3 gives each one its own Mach number, its own
acoustical efficiency and its own peak frequency. Everything before the
branch (the pressure ratios, the jet diameter) and everything after it (the
internal level at the pipe wall, the pipe transmission loss, the level
outside) is common to all five.

**What is new in the 2010 edition, and what this module therefore does.** The
1997 method produced one number. This one produces a **third-octave
spectrum**: Equation (19) spreads the internal level around the peak
frequency, Equation (20a) gives the pipe a transmission loss that changes with
frequency through the ring and coincidence frequencies of Equations (21) to
(23), and only Equation (25) collapses the result back to a single A-weighted
level at 1 m. The band set is the 33 one-third-octave bands from 12,5 Hz to
20 kHz, printed as Table 5.

**Three things in Annex A do not reproduce themselves**, and all three are
recorded in `docs/ERRATA.md`:

* The piping geometry factor is printed as $F_p = 0{,}98$, but every one
  of the six printed vena contracta pressures needs $0{,}984$ to come
  out. The five examples that print a value of $p_{vc}$ all give
  $(F_{LP}/F_P)^2 = 0{,}647\,83$, which is $F_p = 0{,}984$ to six
  digits and not $0{,}98$.
* The equivalent orifice diameter is printed as $d_o = 0{,}010$ m in all
  six columns, where Equation (8c) with the annex's own $N_O = 6$ and
  $A = 0{,}00137$ m² gives $0{,}102$ m. The valve style modifier
  printed on the next row, $F_d = 0{,}30$, is the ratio of the printed
  $d_H = 0{,}030$ m to $0{,}102$ m, so the annex computed with the
  larger value and printed the smaller one.
* Two frequency factors of Table A.2 are printed one power of ten low,
  $G_{x,5}$ and $G_{x,10}$, in a column Table 6 makes
  proportional to $f_i^4$ and which therefore has to rise. The
  transmission losses printed two rows below them are what the corrected
  factors give.

This module implements Clause 5, the standard trim case. The noise-reducing
trims of Clause 6, the expander of Clause 7 and the hydrodynamic case of
IEC 60534-8-4 are separate.

    wall_thickness: float,
    downstream_sound_speed: float,
    *,
    pipe_sound_speed: float = 5000.0,
    air_sound_speed: float = 343.0,

```

Equations (21), (22) and (23).

$$
f_r = \frac{c_s}{\pi D_i}, \qquad f_o = \frac{f_r}{4}\left(\frac{c_2}{c_a}\right), \qquad f_g = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\pi t_S}\frac{c_a^2}{c_s}

## DownstreamPipe

```python

    atmospheric_pressure: float = 101325.0,
    standard_pressure: float = 101325.0,
)
```

The pipe the noise actually comes out of, and what surrounds it.

The last four fields are the values the standard prints for a steel pipe
in air at atmospheric pressure, and they are defaults for that reason,
not settings anyone is expected to change.

**Attributes**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `internal_diameter` | $D_i$, in m. |
| `wall_thickness` | $t_S$, in m. |

## FLOW_COEFFICIENT_CONSTANTS

*Constant* (`dict`).

```python
FLOW_COEFFICIENT_CONSTANTS = {'Cv': 0.0046, 'Kv': 0.0049}
```

## flow_regime

```python
flow_regime(pressure_ratio: float, boundaries: RegimeBoundaries) -> int
```

Which of the five regimes of Clause 5.2 a pressure ratio falls in.

The clause prints the five intervals half open, each one closed at the
top: $x \le x_C$, then $x_C < x \le x_{vcc}$, then
$x_{vcc} < x \le x_B$, then $x_B < x \le x_{CE}$, and finally
$x_{CE} < x$.

Table 3 prints the last one as $x_{CE} \le x$, which would put the
single point $x = x_{CE}$ in two regimes at once. Clause 5.2 is the
normative text and its list is consistent, so this follows the clause;
`docs/ERRATA.md` records the disagreement.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `pressure_ratio` | $x$ of Equation (1). |
| `boundaries` | The output of [`pressure_ratio_boundaries`](/phonometry/reference/api/noise_control/valves/#pressure_ratio_boundaries). |

**Returns:** The regime number, 1 to 5.

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | If the pressure ratio is not a finite number in (0, 1). |

## GasStream

```python
GasStream(
    mass_flow: float,
    inlet_pressure: float,
    outlet_pressure: float,
    inlet_density: float,
    inlet_temperature: float,
    specific_heat_ratio: float,
    molecular_mass: float,
)
```

The gas and the operating point, which Clause 5.1 reads first.

**Attributes**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `mass_flow` | $\dot m$, in kg/s. |

| `inlet_density` | $\rho_1$, in kg/m³. |
| `inlet_temperature` | $T_1$, absolute, in K. |
| `specific_heat_ratio` | $\gamma$. |
| `molecular_mass` | $M$, in kg/kmol. |

## internal_spectrum

```python
internal_spectrum(
    internal_level: float,
    peak_frequency: float,
    frequency: NDArray[np.float64],
) -> NDArray[np.float64]
```

Equation (19): the internal level spread over the third-octave bands.

$$
L_{pi}(f_i) = L_{pi} - 8 - 10 \lg\left\{ \left[1 + \left(\frac{f_i}{2 f_p}\right)^{2,5}\right] \left[1 + \left(\frac{f_p}{2 f_i}\right)^{1,7}\right]\right\}
$$

The two brackets are not symmetric: the spectrum falls as
$f^{-2,5}$ above the peak and as $f^{1,7}$ below it, so a
valve is heard further above its peak than below it. The 8 dB is what
turns an overall level into a one-third-octave one; the NOTE to Table 7
puts 3 dB there for octave bands instead.

**Parameters**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `internal_level` | $L_{pi}$ of Equation (18), in dB. |
| `peak_frequency` | $f_p$ from Table 3, in Hz. |
| `frequency` | The band centre frequencies, in Hz. |

**Returns:** The internal level in each band, in dB.

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | If the peak frequency is not positive and finite, or a band centre is not. |

## jet_diameter

```python

    flow_coefficient: float,
    style_modifier: float,
    pressure_recovery: float,
    *,
    coefficient: str = 'Cv',
) -> float
```

The jet diameter of Equation (9).

$$
D_j = N_{14}\, F_d \sqrt{C\, F_{LP}/F_P}
$$

**Parameters**

| `style_modifier` | $F_d$, from [`valve_style_modifier`](/phonometry/reference/api/noise_control/valves/#valve_style_modifier). |
| `pressure_recovery` | $F_{LP}/F_p$, or $F_L$ for a valve with no attached fittings. |
| `coefficient` | Which flow coefficient `flow_coefficient` is, `"Cv"` or `"Kv"`, which selects $N_{14}$ from Table 1. |

**Returns:** $D_j$, in m.

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | If a value is not positive and finite, or the coefficient is not one Table 1 prints a constant for. |

## MACH_LIMIT_STANDARD_TRIM

*Constant* (`float`).

```python
MACH_LIMIT_STANDARD_TRIM = 0.3
```

## PIPE_SOUND_SPEED_M_S

*Constant* (`float`).

```python
PIPE_SOUND_SPEED_M_S = 5000.0
```

## pipe_transmission_loss

```python

    frequency: NDArray[np.float64],
    *,
    internal_diameter: float,
    wall_thickness: float,
    valve_outlet_diameter: float,
    downstream_density: float,
    downstream_sound_speed: float,
    pipe_density: float,
    pipe_sound_speed: float = 5000.0,
    air_sound_speed: float = 343.0,
    atmospheric_pressure: float = 101325.0,
    standard_pressure: float = 101325.0,
) -> NDArray[np.float64]
```

Equation (20a): what the pipe wall keeps in, band by band.

$$
TL(f_i) = 10 \lg\left[ 8{,}25\times10^{-7} \left(\frac{c_2}{t_S f_i}\right)^2 \frac{G_x(f_i)} {\dfrac{\rho_2 c_2 + 2\pi t_S f_i \rho_s \eta_s(f_i)} {415\, G_y(f_i)} + 1} \frac{p_a}{p_s}\right] - \Delta TL
$$

The result is a large negative number, and Equation (24) *adds* it to the
internal level, so the sign is not a convention this module chose.

**Returns:** The transmission loss in each band, in dB, negative.

**Raises**

| ValueError | If an argument is not positive and finite. |

$$

$$
x_B = 1 - \frac{1}{\alpha} \left(\frac{1}{\gamma}\right)^{\gamma/(\gamma-1)}, \qquad x_{CE} = 1 - \frac{1}{22\,\alpha}
$$

| :--- | :--- |
| `specific_heat_ratio` | $\gamma$ of the flowing fluid. |

**Raises**

| Exception | When |
| :--- | :--- |
| ValueError | If either argument is not positive and finite, or if the specific heat ratio is not above one. |
