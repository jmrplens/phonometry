"""ISO 4871:1996 declaration of noise emission values of machinery and equipment.

ISO 4871 is the standardised *noise-emission declaration*: the information a
manufacturer or supplier states in technical documents about the airborne noise
emitted by a machine (clause 3.13). It does not measure anything itself; it
prescribes which quantities are declared, in which of two alternative forms, and
how a declared value is verified (clauses 4 to 6).

The quantities are the A-weighted sound power level ``L_WA`` (the preferred and
basic quantity, ISO 4871 Note 17) and, optionally, the A-weighted emission sound
pressure level ``L_pA`` at a work station (clause 3.11). Each is declared in one
of two forms selected by the relevant noise test code (clause 4):

* the **dual-number** form (clause 3.16): a measured noise emission value ``L``
  and its associated uncertainty ``K``, stated together but separately, both
  rounded to the nearest decibel; and
* the **single-number** form (clause 3.15): the derived declared value
  ``L_d = L + K``, rounded to the nearest decibel, an upper limit which values
  from repeated measurements are unlikely to exceed at the stated confidence
  level.

``K`` combines the measurement uncertainty (reproducibility) and, for a batch,
the production spread (clauses 3.20 to 3.24; ``K = 1,645 sigma_R`` for a single
machine, Annex A.2.2). Verification (clause 6) compares a verification
measurement ``L_1`` against the declared value: for a single machine it is
verified when ``L_1 <= L_d`` (clause 6.2).

This module models a declaration as :class:`NoiseEmissionDeclaration`, a set of
:class:`OperatingModeDeclaration` values (one per operating mode, clause 4), and
renders it as an ISO 4871 declaration fiche through :meth:`.report`. A
declaration is most often built from a measured sound power via
:meth:`~phonometry.emission.sound_power.SoundPowerResult.declare`.
